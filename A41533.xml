            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT was a Saying of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, There is no new thing under the Sun:</hi> We who live ſome Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years after him, have much more reaſon to ſay ſo, ſeeing we have the experience of ſo many who came after him, and went before us. It is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, that the world follows now the ſame courſe as it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and all the works of God
<pb facs="tcp:57548:7"/>and Nature are ſubmitted to that Order which he ſetled them in from their Creation; the day ſucceeds to the night, one ſeaſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the ſtars have the ſame motions &amp; influences as they had long ago: So it is in matter of Arts and Sciences, which for certain we derive from ſome of thoſe who went before us, from whom we received ſome hints, and direct or indirect lights and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about them: The very opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about matters of Divinity or Phyloſophy, which to ſome ſeem new, were of old: And in this ſenſe there is no new thing under the Sun. Yet every particular man hath not the knowledge of every one of theſe things; and though they had, yet ſome additions may be made to them, there being degrees of Knowledge and Science; and
<pb facs="tcp:57548:7"/>every Art may receive ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional degree of perfection; all do not know all things alike, and ſome thing is ever left to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by our Labours, Studies and Induſtry: And as thoſe who come last, ſtand upon the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of others, ſo they can ſee fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off; and to the experience of the former, they may joyne their own Obſervations, and ſo carry things further then they were before. Therefore rational and judicious men will ſlight no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but they will hear and ſee before they approve or condemn; and yet when they are come to that, they will be wary, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Leſſon which the <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies</hi> ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at his coming down from the Mountain, before the reading of the Law to them, <hi>Be quick to
<pb facs="tcp:57548:8"/>hear, ſlow to ſpeak, ſlower to anger, and ſloweſt of all to judge.</hi> It is a charitable diſpoſition in ſome to be imitated by all, to paſs by the defects of ſome things, for the ſake of ſome perfections in the ſame. And indeed it is but juſtice, that as the good which is in a thing or perſon cannot ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the evil in the ſame; ſo that evil ſhould not make others condemn the good which is in it; but as I condemn a man for his Vices, ſo I muſt commend him for his Vertues; for <hi>I</hi> would eſteem what deſerves to be eſteemed, whereſoever <hi>I</hi> find it.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>I</hi> do ſo as to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of others, the ſame method <hi>I</hi> ought to obſerve about their works. It is an univerſal truth, that every thing here hath its
<pb facs="tcp:57548:8"/>failings and defects. We find ſpots in the Moon, but withall there is a light in it; as long as we receive no harme by the one, and the other is beneficial to us, let us be content without. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, we know that it is not uſual (and <hi>I</hi> dare ſay poſſible) to find one who excells in every thing, but every one applyes himſelf to that which moſt of all ſuits his Genius and Inclination, and conſequently, is the more likely to ſucceed in it; wherefore we ought to hearken to any one about things which are in his own way, and we must not judge till we have ſeen; this being the Rule, <hi>judge not before the time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it on this occaſion: for, to
<pb facs="tcp:57548:9"/>carry on the deſign <hi>I</hi> have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, <hi>I</hi> must in ſome things tread the ſteps of others; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be expected in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the State of ſo ancient and ſo flouriſhing a Republick, ſhould have been kept from the knowledge of other Nations: ſhe hath acted ſo important a part upon the Stages of <hi>EUROPE</hi> and <hi>ASIA,</hi> that the best Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have had matter enough afforded them to ſatisfie the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity of thoſe that were nigh and far off about it; yet all have uſed different wayes, and thoſe who have written after, were never the leſſe acceptable for it, becauſe there is ever one thing or other to be added, omitted or altered, for no man ſaith all that can be ſaid upon a Subject; and if just when things are upon
<pb facs="tcp:57548:9"/>the Stage men do not agree about their true ſtate, what ſhall it be when they are related a long time after? So that People judge of them not onely according to their inclination, but alſo conjunctures and emergencies do in time very much alter the face of things; though in ſome Republicks they are not ſo ſubject to alteration as in moſt Monarchies; for let perſons be what they pleaſe, the Lawes ſtill remain the ſame, and they are the Soveraign; but in the Government of ſingle Perſons they alter according to the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Prince, and the mind of his Miniſters, as they are over-ruled by the neceſſity of Affairs: which I ſpeak of, not that I ſhould think it to be an inconveniency attending Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, ſo far from it, that I look
<pb facs="tcp:57548:10"/>upon it as one of the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of this Government over Republicks; for a liberty is allowed to find remedies fit and proper for new diſtempers felt or feared, when others are doting upon the idol of their old wayes, there wanting in Republicks a perſon by whoſe Authority all the reſt may be over-ſwayed, and be brought to that which the preſent reaſon of State, differing from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, doth require.</p>
            <p>The preſent Wars of <hi>Candia,</hi> (which is the chief, and one place beſides excepted, the only ſtage of action in theſe parts of the world) and ſome kind of ſuperficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I have of the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> made me chuſe the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> as the most important that could be ſpoken of in the preſent
<pb facs="tcp:57548:10"/>Conjuncture; the more, becauſe I thought men would have the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity to know the condition of that Common-Wealth, which at preſent makes ſo much noiſe in the World, by reaſon of her ſtout and vigorous oppoſition to ſo dreadful an Enemy as the <hi>Turk</hi> is. And alſo I am obliged to anſwer a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge I received from ſome perſons of Note, to perform a conditional kind of promiſe I made in my book of <hi>The preſent State of</hi> Italy, in the place where I treat of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, to give a Relation of it: Beſides that, the ſubject is ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in it ſelf, that I could not treat of any Outlandiſh State bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter regulated then this is, though of late, through the private ends of particular men, ſome corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are crept into it, as at one time or other it hath ever fallen
<pb facs="tcp:57548:11"/>out with the beſt Common-Wealths in the World: wherefore in this caſe I ſpeak the good and the bad, I neither flatter nor ſlander, but I commend and condemn, as I ſee occaſion for it, though I do not undertake to paſs any judgment upon things, only I lay them down in their own natural colours.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of my Deſign, I could not omit ſome things ſpoken by others, becauſe they are obvious and neceſſary, which is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in things that have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Common-Place: But I deſire the Reader would take the pains to compare, then he will ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily obſerve the difference of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, and how much I endeavour to uſe a clear and a ſubſtantial Diſcourſe. And becauſe I know that now men care not for long and
<pb facs="tcp:57548:11"/>dear Books, ſome having not much time, and others no money to ſpare that way; therefore I have ſtudied brevity, for fear of being tedious, and have compiled a Book (if I may ſo name theſe few leaves) which ſhall be cheap, and little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to be eaſily carried in a mans pocket; and it will be a great ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to me if ever I do any thing which may prove acceptable and uſeful to the Nation. And as Books as well as Cloathes muſt be modiſh and faſhionable, as now in <hi>France</hi> their <hi>Memoires,</hi> and in <hi>England</hi> Relations; and becauſe a Luſtre is to be given to things, and (to pleaſe Book-ſellers) a conſiderable name to Relations, In this I have conformed my ſelf to that method.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O write well of ſo worthy a Subject, would require the pen of a publick Miniſter, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with a tranſcendent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, who for many years had reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the place, and managed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny publick important affairs, and in a Conjuncture which had produced many Changes and Revolutions, and ſeveral events increaſed and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon of the violence of the minds of men of inveterate enmity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward paſſions, and of nigh and remote intereſts, and who being taught by age, times and experience, which are the right guides, the ſafe and faithful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57548:13"/>of the actions of men, had thereby had fair occaſions of framing a perfect and true Relation of the State of this Republick. But this being not the uſual practiſe of publick perſons, is more to be wiſhed then hoped for; and therefore liberty for that, is left to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, who being not taken up with publick affairs, may ſpare ſome of their time about it. Out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this, I am now deſirous to give the Publick this token of my zeal and affection, wherein I walk upon good, real and ſure grounds: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I intend to avoid ſpeaking of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous and unneceſſary things, I will mention thoſe only which may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial and neceſſary to be known, which I reduce to ſix heads. The <hi>firſt</hi> will be about the whole State of which that Republick is at preſent poſſeſſed either by Land or by Sea, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſomething ſhall be ſaid of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of their more conſiderable in-Land Cities, their Riches, Cuſtomes, and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of their Subjects. In the <hi>Second,</hi> I will treat of their yearly incomes and expences. In the <hi>Third,</hi> Of their Land
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57548:13"/>and Sea Forces, whether they be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary, and wherein they conſiſt. The <hi>Fourth,</hi> ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their manner of Government, and the adminiſtration of their Lawes and Juſtice. In the <hi>Fifth,</hi> I intend to ſpeak of the nature and manners of the <hi>Venetians.</hi> And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I will ſhew how they ſtand affected to their Neighbours and other Princes of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To begin with the firſt, I'le ſay, that this Republick is, by common conſent of all men, eſteemed to be the firſt and the greateſt in Power and Authority of all other States in <hi>Italy:</hi> becauſe ſhe owes to none but to her ſelf the ground; and beginning of her dignity ſhe ever enjoyed her liberty, and never depended on, nor ever owned any Prince as Superiour: beſides that, it is the moſt ancient of any State in <hi>Italy:</hi> for ſhe had her birth in the Year 421, the 25. of <hi>March</hi> about noon, above 1246 years ago; and all this while ſhe made the Lawes whereby ſhe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned her ſelf. 'Tis true, ſhe had but a weak and inconſiderable beginning
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57548:14"/>out of the ruines of ſome Cities of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but in ſucceſſion of time, and with a continual concourſe of people which reſorted to it out of all places round about, ſhe is not only grown very rich, but hath alſo gotten a vaſt and a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Dominion; whence it may well be called a great and a mighty Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, full of Men, Armes and Riches, more then any other State in <hi>Italy.</hi> which upon the continent, or as they call it, <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> hath three whole Provinces, namely, <hi>Iſtria, Friuli,</hi> with the <hi>Marca Trevigiana,</hi> beſides that which ſhe enjoyes in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> either towards the Dukedome of <hi>Milan,</hi> or that of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> which Lands joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with another, may alſo upon occaſion ſupply and aſſiſt each other. But upon the Sea, the Dominion of the <hi>Venetians</hi> goes very far, from <hi>Venice</hi> it ſelf as far as <hi>Candia,</hi> which Iſland alone, if ſhe were in the power of an active Price, could without queſtion much oppoſe the ambition and pride of the Common Enemy; for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſetting forth a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of good Gallies well mann'd, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57548:14"/>provided, they could with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cruſing of the <hi>Archipelago</hi> make prizes of, and diſturb the Ships which daily paſs from <hi>Morea</hi> to <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> whence that City is ſupplyed with an extraordinary quantity of Corn, Oates, and other Proviſions ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for that populous place; of which being deprived, the people in't might ſoon be brought to wants and ſtraits, which might cauſe in it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, tumults, riſings and other extremities which deſpair drives men to: And the truth of this hath real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſeen within theſe few years, when the <hi>Venetians</hi> had ſtopt the mouth of the <hi>Dardanels,</hi> which hath diſcovered to us, that as the ſtrength of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire lies towards <hi>Hungary,</hi> ſo towards the Sea 'tis very weak, and lies much open to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of an invading Enemy; And this I ſay to ſhew how much it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Chriſtians, not only to defend <hi>Candia,</hi> which is the only City of the Iſland left to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> but alſo to endeavour to drive the <hi>Turk</hi> out of the whole Iſland.</p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57548:15"/>
               <p>Beyond <hi>Candia</hi> the Republick hath three petty Iſlands conſiderable, not for any benefit drawn out of them, but only for their ſtrength and further ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, being as it were the out-works of <hi>Candia:</hi> And if the <hi>Venetians</hi> could drive the <hi>Turk</hi> out of this Kingdome, as it is not impoſſible, with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtrength, they being ſtill the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Sea, and in poſſeſſion of the Chief City, it would clearly appear to the world how convenient this is to carb the <hi>Turks</hi> power that way. But beſides this, the <hi>Venetians</hi> have the Iſlands <hi>Corfu, Cefalonia,</hi> and <hi>Zante,</hi> with ſome others diſperſed up and down the <hi>Gulf</hi> nigh to the <hi>Continent,</hi> and are members of <hi>Dalmatia, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania</hi> and <hi>Sclavonia:</hi> though to ſpeak the truth, they are places for the moſt part barren, void of inhabitants, and a neſt of Rogues, and wild Beaſts, and conſequently of no great concernment: So that ſetting aſide the Iſlands I have named, and few others, the reſt are of no benefit, and have more of a ſhew then of any real advantage; in a word, they are more chargeable then beneficial,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57548:15"/>for in themſelves they produce not all things neceſſary for their ſubſiſtance, but are forced to fetch them from other places, eſpecially their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of mouth, wherefore they are inhabited by Seamen, Fiſhermen, Thieves and Pyrates, who after they have committed many violences; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, fellonies, and the like, fly into the States of the <hi>Turk</hi>'s, or of the <hi>Arch-Duke</hi>'s, their Neighbours. But I inſiſt no longer upon this Diſcourſe, but come to the borders and ſituation of other Dominions of the Republick in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eaſtward</hi> it borders with the <hi>Arch-Dukes</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> and the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, now called the <hi>Gulf</hi> of <hi>Venice. Weſtward,</hi> with the <hi>Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> of <hi>Milan. Southward,</hi> with the <hi>Dukedome</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> part of the States <hi>Milan</hi> and of <hi>Mantoa.</hi> And towards the <hi>North,</hi> it hath the Biſhoprick of <hi>Trent,</hi> and a part of the <hi>Griſons</hi> by the means of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which is a paſſage of very great concernment to the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,</hi> through the which they can bring to their aſſiſtance men out of <hi>France, Germany</hi> and <hi>Switzerland:</hi>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57548:16"/>Within the whole State of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick by Land and by Sea, are reckoned 30 Cities, whereof every one is a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick, and between 70 and 80 Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and fortified places: But I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſpeak only of thoſe which are the moſt conſiderable, eſpecially by Land. The Chief of theſe are within the Dominions they have in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which are inferiour to no other State of <hi>Italy,</hi> in the greatneſs of the Cities, the number of people, the fruitfulneſs of the ſoyl, and plenty of all things neceſſary to the life of man.</p>
               <p>But firſt of all, I muſt begin with <hi>Venice,</hi> the Head, and according to the way of Republicks the beſt, the richeſt, and the moſt populous of the State: On every account 'tis a ſingular place, and (eſpecially by reaſon of her Site) may be called a wonder of Art and Nature; for I am ſure all <hi>Europe,</hi> and I believe the whole known world doth not afford the like: <hi>Amſterdam</hi> comes the nigheſt to it, but with a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which nature, and a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time, have put between thoſe two places. Firſt of all, <hi>Venice</hi> was
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57548:16"/>built by a meer hazzard and neceſſity, but afterwards the advantage of her Situation being known, many reſorted thither willingly upon grounds and deliberation: 'Tis ſited upon above 70 little Iſlands, ſeparated one from another by ſeveral Channels: the next place to it from the <hi>Continent,</hi> is at leaſt five miles diſtant, and between two or three from a neck of land called <hi>Lito;</hi> So that being compaſſed about with the Sea, ſhe ſeems to riſe out of it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to be built upon it: Out of ſix places chiefly, as out of ſo many Ports or Harbours; Namely, <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porti, il lido Maggiore, di S. Eraſmo, delle Caſtella, di Malamocco,</hi> and <hi>di Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogia,</hi> people come to't. Amongſt the many Channels which divide the City, there is one called <hi>Canal grande,</hi> which ſeparates the City into two parts, one looks to the <hi>South-weſt,</hi> and the other faces the <hi>North-eaſt,</hi> and both theſe parts of <hi>S. Marco</hi> and <hi>Rialto</hi> are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a marvellous bridge, called <hi>Di Rialto</hi> upon the ſame Channel. Now theſe Channels, upon the which are thought to be 15000 <hi>Gondolaes,</hi> or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57548:17"/>Boates, whereby abundance of poor people get a livelihood, are of great conveniency, not only by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the ſtreets, which are ſo far from being able to receive Coaches (of which there are none in <hi>Venice,</hi> nor indeed is there any uſe for't, nor Sedans, which in thoſe parts of <hi>Italy</hi> are uſed by none but Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) that two men in front fill the whole ſtreet in ſome places; they are alſo convenient for the carrying of things from one place to another, which every moment is neceſſary to be done by reaſon of the great Trade, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Manufactures ſetled in or about the City: of which their glaſs-houſes at <hi>Murano,</hi> an Iſland not far diſtant from the City, are the moſt Famous; this admirable ſecret they have been ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to keep to themſelves, that under pain of death every workman is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to go out of the State; but what will not men dare out of hopes of gain and profit? Therefore not long ſince the <hi>French</hi> found out a way to perſwade ſeveral of them to the number of 8 or 10 to go into <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:57548:17"/>where they are ſetled, and ſucceed well by the encouragement they receive from that King. But as this people were married, they had not been long away from their Wives, when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed they would have them or elſe not ſtay; and ſuch an effectual courſe was taken to ſatisfie them in't, that one undertook to carry Letters to their Wives, and to bring them into <hi>France,</hi> wch he effected, though they narrowly eſcaped thoſe who purſued them.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Venice</hi> is 7 miles in circuit, within which compaſs are a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſtately Palaces, built after the <hi>Gothick</hi> way; beſides 6 <hi>Scnole grandi</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, eſpecially that of <hi>S. Rocco,</hi> with a number of extraordinary pictures, as are great many of their fine Churches; Within it are accounted to be above 300000 ſouls: and as it is a delicious place, ſpecially for ſenſual pleaſures, ſo 'tis an invitation to many ſtrangers to come to it, who are thought to be, comparing one day with another, no leſs then 30000, and hereby one muſt conceive the excellent good order ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to bring all manner of neceſſaries
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57548:18"/>into a place where nothing grows, and where if they will have ſo much as good freſh <hi>water,</hi> except they have it from the rain, they muſt bring it from ſhore, eſpecially from the River <hi>Brenta.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One would think that a place ſeated in the midſt of, and compaſſed about with waters, ſhould be very unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and have an unwholeſome air, there being much filth and corruption caſt into the Channels, ſome of which ſtink very much, ſpecially in ſummer: yet for all this, the air is very good, by reaſon of certain winds which uſually blow gently there, and ſo do purifie it, diſſipating the bad vapours. Alſo the Tide which comes in conſtantly, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away the excrements of the City, ſalt water being no friend to corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; beſides the care which is taken now &amp; then to cleanſe theſe Channels.</p>
               <p>But a City ſited as this is, muſt be very ſtrong; indeed this ſituation is ſo advantagious, that ſhe may diſturb o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not be diſturbed, but with extraordinary and almoſt unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able difficulties, for great ſhips cannot come nigh to it, the water not being deep enough to receive them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57548:18"/>when the Tide is gone; and yet it is too deep for any Land Forces, either Horſe or Foot, to come night to it: Theſe waters do alſo much contribute to her ſafety within; for certainly 'tis very advantagious to the peace and quietneſs of a State, when Subjects are ſo diſtant in places, as not to have an eaſie communication one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Now by the means of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels in <hi>Venice,</hi> people cannot without a long time and great difficulties (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the danger of being diſcovered) meet to plot, and eſpecially to execute any Deſign againſt the State; for the Channels are ſo narrow, their <hi>Trag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hetti,</hi> ſtaires, or landing places, on both ſides of the Channels ſo few, and their bridges ſo ſtrait, as are their ſtreets, that there is no coming to a Body. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the people having reaſon to be content in many things, could hardly be brought to entertain any ſuch thoughts; for the State hath wiſely conſidered how neceſſary it is for Rulers to gratifie people in ſlight things, and of no moment, though they muſt oppoſe them in thoſe of a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57548:19"/>great and weighty concernment; for he who is ſevere and rigid in every thing, who never yields nor diſſembles, but ſhews himſelf wilfull, moroſs and unplacable, doth nothing elſe but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, provoke, and uſe people to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and quarrels.</p>
               <p>I muſt come to <hi>Padoa,</hi> a very Noble and ancient City, greater then any of the reſt under that Republick: for ſhe is above ſeven miles about, very ſtrong, with Bulworks, and a very deep and broad ditch, counterſcarp, and other neceſſary fortification for the defence of a place of ſuch an importance: ſeeing the poſſeſſion of this, was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the ground of the <hi>Venetians</hi> inlarging their Dominion towards <hi>Lombardy,</hi> by which means afterwards by degrees, and under ſeveral preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they got further and further. In this City is the moſt Famous Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of all <hi>Italy,</hi> by reaſon of the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent learning of its Doctors, in all Profeſſions, and of the great number of Schollars: The Country about it doth abound in all manner of Pulſe, Oates, Gattel, Wool, Linnen Cloath, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57548:19"/>Fiſh; but two things cauſe a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to it; The firſt is, That ſhe is too nigh <hi>Venice:</hi> which with the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of a Navigable River, conveys from thence in vaſte quantities the things I expreſſed: inſomuch, that ſometimes it hath been neceſſary to get back from <hi>Venice,</hi> things neceſſary for the ſubſiſtance of that City. A Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing which prejudices that place, is, becauſe many years ago, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men in <hi>Venice</hi> having neglected their Sea affairs, have given themſelves to purchaſe in the <hi>Padovano, Treviſano,</hi> and <hi>Poleſene,</hi> Territories in ſuch aquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, that at preſent the Nobles of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> have three parts of four in that of <hi>Padova,</hi> to the great impoveriſhment of the inhabitants, who formerly had competent means to live well upon, but are now poor: there being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove five or ſix families worth above 2000 Crowns a year, and none of the reſt hath 1000: And were it not for the great concourſe of Schollers, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially out-landiſh, they would be in a worſe condition. On the other ſide, ſome of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility make
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57548:20"/>uſe of their prerogative with ſo much liberty and authority, that the <hi>Pado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> look upon themſelves to be in a miſerable condition, as indeed this City is the hardeſt dealt withall of all others within that State of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; the reaſon is, that thoſe of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doa</hi> being of a proud and revengefull nature, upon the leaſt occaſion they fall out, commit extravigancies, and kill one another, after which immediately their goods are confiſcated, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently bought by ſome <hi>Venetian.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, this people is ſo given to do miſchief, that they are almoſt undone before they can come off the troubles they brought thereby upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Padoa</hi> comes <hi>Vicenza,</hi> which though ſhe be no great City, is at leaſt as well peopled as the former, there being in it above 30000 perſons; 'tis afair City, pleaſant, plentiful, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich, but the people are dangerous, offenſive and cruel. In all the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> there are no Subjects ſo bloody and revengeful as the <hi>Vicentines</hi> are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be: whom 'tis no prudence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57548:20"/>to truſt; The reaſon of it is, becauſe their faults and wickedneſſes are but lightly puniſhed except it be in very horrid crimes, wherof the cauſe is, That in point of criminal juſtice, the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Magiſtrates in <hi>Vicenza</hi> may give no ſentence without the advice of ſome of the Chief Citizens who are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that purpoſe, by vertue of an ancient priviledge of the City, of whom one half are Gown-men, and the other half are Tradeſ-men, and they ever have a ſhare in matters of juſtice with the <hi>Rettore</hi> and his Court; and this juriſdiction is called the <hi>Conſolaria;</hi> whence it is that conſtantly they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote the <hi>Poteſta</hi> (this is the name of the Chief Magiſtrate in every City) and his Court: This is their way of abſolving or chaſtizing the guilty for the faults which daily are committed amongſt them; but becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick took notice, that in crimes of a higher nature, juſtice was not duly adminiſtred, after a debate upon the matter it was reſolved to elect an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Magiſtrate, called <hi>Avoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> who upon occaſion of hainous
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57548:21"/>faults ſhould go into the City to get ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret informations of the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which being done, he brings it to <hi>Venice,</hi> where ſentence is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Thus great miſchiefs are reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and juſtice is duly executed: but this manner of proceeding diſpleaſes very much, and cauſes great alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the minds of thoſe high ſpirits, who ſee their priviledges are thereby weakned and derogated from; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the <hi>Vicentines</hi> ſeeing they have in their hands no ſtrong holds, nor none that can be made ſuch, think it fit to yield obedience in a thing which is juſt in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now follows the City of <hi>Verona,</hi> which hath ſix miles in circuit; ſhe is one of the faireſt within the <hi>Venetian</hi> Dominions, with a very large Ditch, Counterſcarps, and good Bulwarks; in the midſt of it is the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> very ſtrong, ſtored with all manner of proviſion and ammunition; the City is ſtrongly ſeated in the midſt of a great, open, and champion Country, and in a place ſomewhat high, 'tis backt with ſome little hills, upon the which is another
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57548:21"/>Caſtle, with other ſtrong fortifications, which command the Countrey about: and through the middle of the City runs the River <hi>Agide,</hi> very great and navigable, which falling into the <hi>Gulf</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> the City may eaſily receive thence ſupplies of men and proviſion. She is one of the Chief Keyes of <hi>Italy,</hi> towards <hi>Germany,</hi> as it appeared clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the wars of <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, Emperours againſt the Republick. That it hath been a conſiderable City the Amphitheatre there, which is the leaſt defaced of any in <hi>Italy,</hi> doth teſtifie: and Hiſtories tell us, that when ſome of the Family <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> were Lords of it, ſhe was the head of a potent State, of which <hi>Padoa, Vicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, Treviſo, Ceneda, Belluno, Feltre, Breſcia, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Luca,</hi> were mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
               <p>Part of its Territory is barren, of ſixty miles in length; but for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfulneſs, there is never great plenty in the City, which as well as <hi>Vicenza</hi> hath the <hi>Conſolaria;</hi> and though thoſe of <hi>Verona</hi> be not ſo bad as the <hi>Vicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tini,</hi> nor do not ſo many miſchiefs, yet

Within the Juriſdiction of this City are two indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent good ſtrong holds; one is <hi>Leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nago</hi> towards the <hi>Mantoan,</hi> which alſo doth defend that part of the <hi>Padoan;</hi> the other is <hi>Peſchigra,</hi> of a far greater concernment then the former, for 'tis accounted to be the Key of all other places beyond the River <hi>Mincio:</hi> whence 'tis eaſie to make incurſions upon all other places thereabouts; if once this were loſt, all the reſt would be in a great danger: Thoſe of <hi>Verona</hi> are accounted to be of a proud nature, &amp; of a fantaſtical humour. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I think it not amiſs to mention a Proverb uſual in thoſe parts, when ſome great miſchief hath been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there (which happens very often) they uſe to ſay, <hi>Such a miſchief hath been committed according to the cuſtome
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57548:23"/>of</hi> Padoa, Vicenza <hi>and</hi> Verona: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is meant the number of murthers without grounds, which is according to the temper of the people: The truth is, a great number of murthers and of like miſchiefs is daily committed in thoſe Countries, and in the reſt of the Republick, and as far as I could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, this is chiefly cauſed by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of ſome of the Nobles, and by the favour they ſhew to delinquents in ſuch caſes. 'Tis very ſtrange, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Tryal for a mans Eſtate, no body will ſpeak a word for him; for in this matter they are juſt enough; but upon life and death, for murther, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked act, provided it be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State, there will be friends enough to ſpeak on ones behalf; So that in this, juſtice often is corrupted by favour. Thoſe of <hi>Verona</hi> are further of a High and Lordly carriage, becauſe they are very rich, but ſpend it very profuſely, and often they run very deep into debts.</p>
               <p>Then is <hi>Breſcia</hi> a very Noble City, ſited in a levelled ground, yet at the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57548:24"/>foot of ſome hills: it hath four miles, and two hundred paces in circuit. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hill is a Caſtle of very great ſtrength, with Ravelins, Bullwarks, and ſure places for ſuccours infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to come in, with ſuch ſtore of proviſion and ammunition, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to probability they may hold out for ſeveral years in their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. There are alſo ſprings of very good water; with a matter of ſix ſcore pieces of Ordinance. Between the City and the Caſtle are places under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground, and Vaults very deep, through the which can come to them all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of relief. Above the City is a ditch of thirteen paces broad, with Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, and the Walls have good Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts; in it are above 62000 Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who are ſo throug'd by reaſon of the great quantity of Wares, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of all manner of Armes, that in it there is no place empty; and as <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi> is the faireſt, this is the richeſt, and the moſt Merchant of all others: There are not many fine houſes, for thoſe of <hi>Breſcia</hi> do not much care for the Magnificence of Palaces. The Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57548:24"/>is 100 miles in length, and 50 in breadth, and about 300 in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and is full of all things. This City hath within her Juriſdiction, above 240 Towns, wherein are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to be 350000 Souls: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the City enjoys a very noble pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That no man, of what Nation ſoever he be, though he were a <hi>Venetian,</hi> may purchaſe any Lands within her Territory, except he be a <hi>Breſcian;</hi> and herein doth conſiſt the ſafety and the greatneſs of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, all the States thereabouts remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporated to the Citizens. So that for this, as other Conceſſions which the Republick hath granted them; Namely, That the Citizens are choſen to be <hi>Rectors Poteſtá,</hi> or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate of all Towns and Caſtles within their Juriſdiction: <hi>Breſcia</hi> is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of all other Cities within the State of the Republick. They have further in their hands two Fortreſſes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, <hi>(viz.) Aſola</hi> and <hi>Orcinvovi,</hi> which laſt hath been of late repaired, and reduced to a perfect and Royal Fortification; 'tis of the bigneſs of a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57548:25"/>mile and a half, ſeated in a Champion Countrey, and flank'd or ſided by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Bullwarks, with a large and a deep ditch; in a word, 'tis ſafe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough upon all occaſions. Thoſe of <hi>Breſcia</hi> are very rich, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proud; their Pomp and Ambition is to keep a great Attendance, and to ſet forth themſelves and their Women in Cloaths, Coaches, Liveries, and fine Horſes, but above all, they delight in great, delicious, and coſtly banquets; yet they take great pleaſure to ſtand upon their Armes, as much as in any thing elſe; and ſo they may well do, more then any other place ſubject to the <hi>Venetians:</hi> for the Republick is but ſlow, and very circumſpect, as in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ſo in puniſhing them, becauſe 'tis a frontier place towards the <hi>Milane</hi>'s and the <hi>Breſcians</hi> are very ſenſible of wrongs; beſides that, being ſo remote, the <hi>Venetians</hi> are not ſo well acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, and cannot reach them ſo well as they do other nearer Cities. Nevertheleſs they are not free from burthens, for as it is the beſt of their Cities, ſo they lay upon it great Taxes,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57548:25"/>Contributions and quartering of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, for the Republick is in a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual jealouſie of that place, cauſed by her Neighbour-hood with <hi>Milan,</hi> whence ſome attempts could be made upon it, and ſome ſuccours called in, in caſe of a defection; and ſhould the <hi>Venetian</hi> loſe it, they would thereby be deprived of one of the Chief mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Republick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bergamo</hi> is a pleaſant City, which many years ago was much fortified, it being alſo upon the frontiers of the <hi>Dukedome</hi> of <hi>Milan:</hi> She is 3 miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſtrengthned with 9 Bullwarks, and ſome Counterforts raiſed upon a hill of a conſiderable height, which are as a platform to the City, which is well ſtored with all neceſſaries, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion and ammunition: There are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 26000 Souls in it, and not many more within the Territory, which is poor and barren, producing Corn to ſerve only 6 moneths in the year: this is the reaſon wherefore this people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not very well to live at home, do diſperſe themſelves through the would more then any of their Neighbours:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57548:26"/>They are ſo full of wit, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of a booriſh converſation, that where they go, they Trade ſo as to grow very rich for the moſt part; and in <hi>Venice</hi> particularly, there are thoſe of <hi>Bergamo,</hi> whoſe Fathers and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been Porters, and ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour ſort of people, who at preſent have Lands, Palaces, and other great Riches. In <hi>Bergamo</hi> they live very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly, becauſe by reaſon of their poverty, and the barrenneſs of their Countrey, they are the leſs burthened: and being ſo remote they ſuffer not the injuries which others undergo. They trade in Wools, wherewith they made broad cloaths, which in houſes are uſed inſtead of hangings; they have alſo ſome Iron mines; it borders with the <hi>Valteline</hi> on the North, with <hi>Milan</hi> on the Weſt, with the <hi>Cremoneſe</hi> on the South, and with the <hi>Breſcian</hi> on the Eaſt. The whole length is 50 miles, and the breadth 36; it hath within her Juriſdiction 236 places, the people whereof minde Wool and Cattel.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:57548:26"/>
               <p>The City of <hi>Crema</hi> is the laſt place the Republick hath in <hi>Lombardy:</hi> ſited in a level ground, but built after the old <hi>Gothick</hi> way, and of late hath been repaired with all poſſible induſtry; they have made to it ſome Bulwarks, Ramparts, Platforms, and other charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Fortifications, beſides the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ditch. It is two miles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in compaſs, and contains 26000 Souls; her Territory is ſo narrow, that 'tis not above 25 miles in length, but it is ſo fruitful, and hath ſuch a plenty of all things neceſſary to life, that not only it may compare with any, but alſo goes beyond the moſt plentiful of all <hi>Lombardy,</hi> ſupplying others which want it; 'tis ſaid to produce at leaſt 250000 horſe loads of all mannet of Corn, beſides great quantities of Flax and Wines. This City is ſeated in the midſt of the Territories of <hi>Cremona Lodi,</hi> and other places of the <hi>Milan</hi>'s, ſo that there is but one way to go to it, and on all ſides it is beſet and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about (as it were a priſon) with ſouldiers, and is kept with an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care and watchfulneſs.</p>

               <p>All the places which the <hi>Venetians</hi> have in <hi>Lombardy</hi> are very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then which better cannot be ſeen nor deſired: becauſe thoſe Cities are reckoned amongſt the greateſt in <hi>Italy,</hi> and are very populous, rich, full of trade, and which for abundance and plenty of all things may compare with any in that Country; but they go beyond in ſtatelineſs of buildings, in the extent of many great and rich Towns and Caſtles, and in every thing elſe that proceeds from mans induſtry. One only thing there is, whereat the people are diſſatisfied, <hi>(to wit)</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency of ſeveral of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: who would every one of them be lookt upon as their Maſter and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, and be reſpected, yea, obeyed in things which are neither juſt nor honeſt; becauſe theſe take upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the command by the connivance of other Nobles who will not oppoſe them; whence do ariſe ſometimes to people great dammages ruine and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: So much the beſt of things are ſubject to be abuſed.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:57548:28"/>
               <p>But I will proceed and ſay, that at preſent the <hi>Venetians</hi> have a State in <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> or upon the <hi>Continem,</hi> which is extended above 1000 miles, which they made a ſhift to get by the improvement they made of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions given them by their Leagues and Confederacies with the Dukes of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> the <hi>Viſconti</hi> or Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> with the <hi>Florentines, French</hi> and other <hi>Nations,</hi> for they were ſure to keep better that which they got nearer at hand. Thus, firſt of all, <hi>Trevigi</hi> fell into their hands, then <hi>Verona,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Breſcia,</hi> and ſo from hand to hand, all the forenamed places in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> beſides thoſe of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> formerly Subjects to the Crown of <hi>Hungary:</hi> becauſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick ever declaring her ſelf the head of the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſhe got and united to her former State one thing or other: as in the Wars of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> ſhe had <hi>Il poleſene di Rovigo,</hi> and ſo it hath been of the reſt of her State, either by Land or by Sea. And to ſpeak the truth, the Republick hath laid the foundation of her Dominions juſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57548:29"/>as the <hi>Turks,</hi> and others have done of theirs, that is, by the means of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Differences and Quarrellings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Neighbours: and alſo by reaſon of ſo many petty Lords, who falling our one with another, became in time an eaſie prey to the Republick, which probably would have attempted and effected the ſame over the reſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> if they had ſeen grounds and favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occaſions to do it.</p>
               <p>Beſides the State of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> the Republick hath 3 whole Provinces, namely <hi>Iſtria, Friuli,</hi> and <hi>Marca Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigiana;</hi> in the firſt are five, though ſmall Cities, with ſome Caſtles; but becauſe their air is very bad, and ſomewhat infectious, the Countrey is not peopled, and ſo the ground is neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and barren; yet for all this, the Republick draws out of it a great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from the Salt which is made there in great abundance, beſides other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary proviſions, as Fleſh; Fiſh, Wood, Timber, Fewel, Oyl, and excellent Free-Stone, with other things from thence carried to <hi>Venice.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Friuli</hi> hath three Cities, one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57548:29"/>is <hi>Aquileja,</hi> that ancient City, which upon good reaſon may be called, the Mother of <hi>Venice;</hi> for, this laſt was peopled in part by the inhabitants of the former: It is a Patriarchate of which Cardinal <hi>Delphini</hi> is the preſent Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch: The <hi>Romans</hi> built it to ſtop the Incurſions into <hi>Friuli</hi> of the Enemies of the Empire, this being the paſſage through the <hi>Carnichian Alpes,</hi> which yet could not be ſecured by the places of <hi>Gradiſca</hi> and <hi>Goritia;</hi> for in the dayes of <hi>Bajazet,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> came that way between the two Towns, almoſt to the Gates of <hi>Trevigi;</hi> therefore the <hi>Venetians</hi> have built there <hi>Palma:</hi> But beſides <hi>Aquileja,</hi> there are two other Cities, the one is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dine,</hi> and the other <hi>Cividal;</hi> the firſt is ſited in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion Countrey, and the laſt between the Mountains, ſcant of Corn, but rich in Cattel and Wines, as is the whole Countrey, which wines are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into ſeveral parts of <hi>Italy;</hi> it hath alſo ſome Iron and Steele in <hi>Cadore,</hi> a Fortreſs ſtrongly ſited upon a hill. In this Province is alſo that extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrong place <hi>Palma Nuova,</hi> which
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:57548:30"/>is a wonder to beholders, having been built with all the Art and Induſtry which the ſpirit of men could deviſe, according to the beſt rules of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>De Marca Trevigiana</hi> hath 3 ſmall Cities, whereof the Chief is <hi>Treviſo,</hi> very ſtrong by reaſon of the ſituation, and that it cannot be undermined: This Country abounds with Corn, Fiſh, Wines, all manner of Pulſe; Beaſts, Cattel, and Fruits, but above all, with Timber for the <hi>Arſenal;</hi> amongſt ſeveral Woods: there being one of 15 miles in length. In that Province are alſo very Noble and fair Caſtle-Towns, pretty rich, Merchant and Populous. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick hath <hi>Il Poleſene di Rovigo,</hi> which like another <hi>Puglia</hi> doth wonderfully abound with all manner of Corn, Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel and Fiſh: But I will not inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, nor upon what they have in other places, but come to ſome of their ſtrong Holds.</p>
               <p>The Fortifications and ſtrong Holds of all the States of <hi>Venice,</hi> do lye in two places, namely in <hi>Lombardy</hi> upon the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57548:30"/>Frontiers of the Dukedome of <hi>Milan,</hi> and toward the Sea ſide; the one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Neighbourhood of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and the other, by reaſon of their being expoſed to the attempts of the <hi>Turks:</hi> To this effect all their places in <hi>Lombardy</hi> have Garriſons in them more or leſs. <hi>Oreinvovi</hi> is good to help <hi>Crema, Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo; Pontevico</hi> is for <hi>Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Bergamo, Legnago</hi> for <hi>Verona, Vicenza</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doa;</hi> ſo is the Fort of <hi>Peſchiero;</hi> there are alſo Garriſons in their places along the Sea; in <hi>Friuli</hi> is the moſt important Fortreſs <hi>Marano,</hi> ſeated between Ponds and Mooriſh grounds, then <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Monfalcone,</hi> with <hi>Oſofo</hi> and <hi>Cadore</hi> little Holds, and able to receive only a ſmall Garriſon, but of a very ſtrong Situation, being on the top of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Rocks. In <hi>Slavonia</hi> are <hi>Zaea</hi> ſtrongly built, <hi>Cataro,</hi> of a ſtrong ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and <hi>Cliſta,</hi> a moſt important place within theſe few years conquered by the Republick; <hi>Trau</hi> alſo and <hi>Sebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico</hi> are very good places, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>S. Nocolo de Sebenico</hi> is very ſtrong. I ſhall hardly mention the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57548:31"/>Iſlands, <hi>Corfú, Cefalonia</hi> and <hi>Zante,</hi> which being Out-works againſt the <hi>Turk</hi> have been fortified very much; and ſeeing the City of <hi>Candia</hi> hath holden out ſo long againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> I think I am diſpenſed to ſpeak of her ſtrength; only I'le add, that in thoſe things which concern the Defence of their States, they have ſpared neither charges nor pains: and they keep their places conſtantly provided with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and neceſſary proviſions for many years, whereby they are ſecured from all invaſions: eſpecially their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which are able not only to receive, but alſo to deſtroy, any conſiderable Army: And let this be enough concerning the Land and Sea States of that Republick.</p>
               <p>The Revenues and yearly Incomes are at preſent very great; not ſo much by reaſon of their Trade by Sea (which firſt the <hi>Portuguezes</hi> ſpoiled, when they found out a way to bring Spices and Jewels from the <hi>Indies,</hi> and now the preſent War with the <hi>Turk</hi>) as by Land, where, as 'tis already ſaid, they are in poſſeſſion of ſome of the greateſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57548:31"/>Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> with very large and moſt plentifull Territories: ſeeing <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gamo</hi> is 50 miles in length, and of a great breadth; that of <hi>Breſcia</hi> 100, <hi>Verona</hi> 60: which Dominions are full of Towns, and of vaſte numbers of people, which in all, is accounted to come, to above three millions of Souls, all very induſtrious and much given to Trade: Where are alſo Biſhopricks, Abbies, and Monaſtries of all ſorts, of the richeſt of <hi>Italy,</hi> and Families illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious for their Nobleneſs of extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and quality, and very conſiderable by the greatneſs of their riches: which to ſpeak of (eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Venice</hi>) are vaſte and exceeding great. So we might mention thoſe of great Cities, chiefly in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion can aſſiſt, as they have done it of late years, and relieve the neceſſities of the Republick in other places; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the State yields to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countrey for plenty of all things: wherein <hi>Venice</hi> being the Head of all, may be accounted a happy City, if that may be called a true happineſs which depends upon the will of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57548:32"/>for <hi>Venice</hi> wants within her ſelf every thing neceſſary to life, wherewith ſhe is ſupplyed part from her own States, from the Popes, from the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and in ſome things out of <hi>England,</hi> and other places: which ſupplies if ſhe were deprived of, ſhe could ſoon fall into great wants. So it is not to be wondered at, if that Republick uſes all poſſible means, and is at great charges (and even now with great danger, by reaſon of the preſent War) to be at peace, and hold good correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency with the <hi>Ottamons:</hi> becauſe her Iſlands, Rivers, and the reſt of her States nigh the Sea, are much expoſed to danger and invaſions from thence, even to their utter ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; beſides, that <hi>Venice,</hi> as I have ſaid, hath no Territory ſufficient to ſubſiſt by, and her Iſlands, Rivers and Sea-Towns do not produce proviſions ſufficient for the third part of the year; ſo that they are continually depending for ſupplies upon other places, and no Prince can do it ſo plentifully, with ſo much eaſe, and leſs charges, then the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57548:32"/>
                  <hi>Turk,</hi> who withdrawing theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, can put them to inconveniencies: as they find it by experience in the preſent War, which now doth almoſt wholly interrupt the Sea trade, and in part that by Land. And as <hi>Venice</hi> is a Merchant City, thoſe riches which are drawn from the <hi>Levant,</hi> muſt needs receive ſome prejudice by it: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well known to that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, although the War be very hot in <hi>Candia,</hi> after the death of their late Miniſter at that Court, they have ſent <hi>Molino</hi> to ſupply his place; and they will ever embrace Peace upon any tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable conditions. To this may be added the iuſtitution and form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Republick, which is ayming at peace, having found out by her own experience, how much ſhe is concerned to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>But to return again to the preſent Subject, I will ſay, that the riches of that State in a peaceable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and before the late War, were raiſed to above three Millions and a half of Gold by the year, which is a very conſiderable ſum: ſince we find, that ſeveral years ago, though the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57548:33"/>were in actual poſſeſſion of the Kingdome of <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Candia,</hi> and of ſome other places, both by Land and by Sea, their yearly Revenue did not exceed two Millions and an half. But the Farmes have been ſo raiſed, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, Taxes, and other burthens, ſo increaſed (though to the great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Subjects) that it cannot be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. The City of <hi>Venice,</hi> one year with another, yields above one Million and an half of Duckets (pieces of gold, worth nine ſhillings and ſix-pence of <hi>Engliſh</hi> money) raiſed upon Wines (for every Pipe brought in, five Duckets are paid, and ſo of the Malmſie or <hi>Candy</hi> Wines) Salt, of which there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and very dear, and of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported or exported Commodities: the Republick furniſhing ſeveral parts of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> with Drugs, Wax, Glaſſes and Cryſtals, Sope, Silk, Silver and Gold, Manufactures, Iron-works, and ſeveral other things; they alſo make a great benefit of Fiſh, Fleſh, Oyls, and of the Ware-houſes which <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> have in the City, of Taxes upon Lands, Houſes, and other Goods not
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57548:33"/>moveable; ſo that in the City of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> alone, out of all the forenamed things, they raiſe one Million, ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety ſeven thouſand, ſeven hundred twenty two Duckets.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Padoa,</hi> they have one hundred thirty ſix thouſand and ſeventy eight Duckets.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Vicenza,</hi> One hundred thirty four thouſand ſeven hundred and forty two Duckets.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Verona,</hi> Two hundred and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand, and eighty four Duckets.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Breſcia,</hi> Three hundred thirty ſeven thouſand, ſix hundred ninety three Duckets.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Bergamo,</hi> One hundred four thouſand, ſeven hundred thirty Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Crema,</hi> Thirty ſeven thouſand five hundred and twenty ſix Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
               <p>From the whole <hi>Poteſene,</hi> Forty thouſand ninety ſeven Duckets.</p>
               <p>From the Province called <hi>Marca Trevigiana,</hi> in all, One hundred eighty four thouſand four hundred eighty five Duckets.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:57548:34"/>
               <p>From the Province of <hi>Friuli,</hi> Fifty two thouſand ſeven hundred ſixty ſix Duckets.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Iſtria,</hi> Six thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thirty four Duckets.</p>
               <p>From all the <hi>States</hi> of the Sea, Eight hundred ſeven and thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, nine hundred ſixty ſix Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
               <p>Which all ſum'd up together, makes Three Millions, ſeven hundred, nine and fifty thouſand, one hundred twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one Duckets.</p>
               <p>Theſe are their ordinary Incomes, but upon extraordinary occaſions they alſo have ſeveral other wayes of raiſing monies; namely, by raiſing of Taxes, or calling twice a year for that which ſhould be paid but once; So they do of Farmes and Cuſtomes upon import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or exported Commodities: they alſo leſſen the pay of their great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and reduce it to half of what it was before; and if this be not enough, they admit into the Order of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, whom they think fit: every one paying 100000 Crowns for it. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they ſell ſome places, which at
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57548:34"/>other times are freely given. Thus they have ſo much increaſed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Procuratori,</hi> or Proctors of <hi>S. Mark.</hi> And laſt of all, they borrow monies from particular perſons: and upon urgent neceſſity, ſeveral of the Nobles make ſometimes liberal and free Contributions: as indeed many who are mighty rich, are very able to do it.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, their expences are very great and neceſſary, becauſe as I ſaid before, all their Dominions at Sea and Land, being compaſſed about or bordered by the <hi>Turks</hi> Territories, and other Princes; the Republick is forced, beſides the charges of buildings, repairings, fortifications and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to keep in every place good and ſtrong Garriſons both of Horſe and Foot, which are very chargeable; the number of their ordinary Guards and Garriſons by Land and by Sea, in time of peace comes to 10000 Foot, and 700 Horſe: but every year there is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſome extraordinary expences both at Sea and Land. But how great muſt they be now; by reaſon of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57548:35"/>War with the <hi>Turk,</hi> which hath laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe ſeveral years? But becauſe the expences of the Republick, with admirable order and exact rule, are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſeveral Offices, I think it will be profitable and neceſſary to know the particulars of it: as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them from knowing and credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons.</p>
               <p>About the charges and expences of the Republick, there are ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and under ſeveral names, called by them <hi>Caſſe,</hi> Cheſts, or places where they lay up things: which ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a diſtribution or aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the monies raiſed out of the Revenue, and to be diſpoſed of, by ſuch a Cheſt in <hi>Venice.</hi> So that every one of theſe <hi>Caſſe</hi> hath its particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes aſſigned to it out of ſuch Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, Taxes, or the like. Wherefore the Chamberlains, <hi>Camerlengh,</hi> as they call them; or rather Treaſurers of the City, are ordered to pay unto every one of theſe Cheſts or Offices in <hi>Venice</hi> the revenues aſſigned to them: which afterwards they lay out according to order peculiar to every Office, and this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57548:35"/>in a good and due order without any confuſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There are the expences made by the three Treaſurers or Directors, who have the management of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Republick, who have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them Notaries, Writers, caſters of Accounts, Overſeers, and ſeveral others in pay, to keep the particulars of every thing that brings in monies: This Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice one year with another doth ſpend above One thouſand four hundred Duckets. There are alſo the expences of the Chamberlains <hi>di Commune,</hi> who pay the allowance of the <hi>Doge,</hi> their own, of the <hi>Cenſori, delle Quarantie,</hi> of the Colledges, and of other Magiſtrates who are under pay; their expences one year with another, do amount to one hundred ſeventy two thouſand four hundred and fifty Duckets. Then there are the charges of the <hi>Proveditori di Commune,</hi> whoſe Office is to build and to repair Bridges, Harbours, lay foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and do other publick build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: for the which are laid out one year with another, about forty eight thouſand three hundred ſeventy ſeven
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57548:36"/>Duckets. The Office <hi>Delle Blade,</hi> or of all manner of Corn, for the Salary of the Officers thereof, ſpends above two thouſand ſeven hundred and ten Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
               <p>The Office of the <hi>Sopraſtanti, alle camere,</hi> overſeers, or preſidents of the Chambers, whoſe care is to pay the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Officers of War, Colonels, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Cities, the forces of <hi>Terra Firma, Dalmatia</hi> and <hi>Albania,</hi> and thoſe who belong to the Office, doth one year with another ſpend about eight hundred ſeventy ſeven thouſand on hundred and forty Duckets; but this is to be underſtood in time of peace, for in time of War, expences are greater, and ſometimes uncertain. The Office <hi>Delle Zeccha,</hi> or coyning monies, payes workmen about it, and provides all neceſſary tools and inſtruments: which amounts to four thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety five Duckets.</p>
               <p>The Office of the <hi>Sette Savi,</hi> at <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alto,</hi> ſpends one year with another five hundred fifty four Duckets. The Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice <hi>Della Legna,</hi> about wood, timber, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> layes out for Salaries ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57548:36"/>and eighty Duckets. The Office <hi>Delle Beccarie</hi> gives to many penſioners one thouſand three hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Duckets by the year. The Office <hi>Dell Aque,</hi> about waters, in prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any harm they can do, either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſhore, or within the land, rivers, lakes, ponds, and the like, by rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing banks, ſconces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then in lead, water pipes, iron, and other things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to fountains, doth ſpend about ſeventy two thouſand ſix hundred ninety four. The Office <hi>Delle Fortezze,</hi> whoſe charge it is to make new forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications or repair the old ones, doth ſpend by the year above twenty five thouſand nine hundred eighty three Duckets.</p>
               <p>The Office <hi>delle Raggioni vecchi,</hi> which hath charge to lay out monies for the publick Proceſſions which often are made in <hi>Venice,</hi> payes the charges of the Dukes Chancery, provides the balls wherewith Magiſtrates do vote and make their Elections, defrayes the reception of thoſe who are received and treated at the publick charges, and payes for the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ge</hi>'s Funeral: it doth
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57548:37"/>ſpend about two and twenty thouſand ſix hundred ſeventeen Duck ets. Buta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable expence is that of <hi>the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice about the Arſenal,</hi> upon Officers and Workmen, which amounts one year with an other to twelve thouſand ſeven hundred ſixty ſix Duckets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides monies laid out upon materials, as timber, hemp, pitch, oares, all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tackling, and other things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Ships and Gallies, whereupon they beſtow one hundred and twenty thouſand two hundred forty five Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
               <p>Then follow the expences for the ordinary ſubſiſtance of the Forces they keep conſtantly on Foot for the guard and ſafety of their Sea dominions; as firſt the pay of the <hi>Proveditor,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and other Officers, which amount taking one year with another, to Two hundred ſixty ſeven thouſand three hundred ninety ſix Duckets. Then the charges for the Biskets neceſſary to the Gallies conſtantly kept in time of peace, and for victuals, come to Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fifty three thouſand, one hundred thirty ſix Duckets. And for the row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57548:37"/>cloathes of Serges, canvas, linnen cloathes, ſhoes, and ſuch neceſſary things, they ſpend thirty nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand one hundred forty eight Duc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
               <p>Further, the Exchequor of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiglio di dieci,</hi> doth ſpend great ſums of monies, in the pay of rewards to them who have taken or killed the <hi>Banditi</hi> (men fled away for rebellion or fellony) for the guards of the places of <hi>Rialto,</hi> and <hi>San Marco,</hi> for gifts beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral ſtrangers, for Courriers, Frigates, and the like expences: which come every year, that is, one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, to One hundred twenty ſeven thouſand, three hundred eighty five Duckets. Then to the Exchequor of the <hi>Colledgio,</hi> do belong to make the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creteſt expences of the State, ſeeing this Office pays the ordinary expences of Reſidents, and Ambaſſadour of the <hi>Bailo</hi> (ſo they call their Ambaſſadour there) at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, gifts and acknowledgements, which in time of peace the Republick payes to the <hi>Turk:</hi> And becauſe this laſt particular doth above all the reſt
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57548:38"/>excite curioſity, I think 'twill not be amiſs to ſay ſomething of it, according to very credible informations given to me about it.</p>
               <p>In time of peace uſually the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick paid to the <hi>Turk</hi> for the Kingdom of <hi>Candia</hi> ſeven thouſand five hundred and fifty <hi>Zecchini</hi> (pieces of Gold of of their coyning, every one of which is worth between nine and ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings;) for the Iſland <hi>Zante</hi> ſhe doth pay five hundred <hi>Zecchini.</hi> There are beſides the expences of the ordinary gifts, and of the extraordinary, not only for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> himſelf, but alſo for the <hi>Grand Viſiro,</hi> and <hi>Baſhaw</hi>'s, namely cloath of Gold, Silver, Silk, and of Wool, with rich Beds, Purple, Wax, and ſeveral other fine things of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable value: and to the <hi>Baili</hi> of the <hi>Levant,</hi> as <hi>Gran Cairo, Alexandria, Aleppo,</hi> and ſome few others. Which expences in time of peace have been of of very great concernment, and it hath been accounted one of the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and concerns of the Republick. And I have been credibly informed, and by judicious and knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57548:38"/>that before the preſent War broke forth, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> did coſt the Republick at leaſt ſix hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Duckets by the year.</p>
               <p>The Cheſt for the ordinary Militiaes of <hi>Candia</hi> and <hi>Corfù</hi> coſt two hundred thouſand Duckets; that which is to pay <hi>La Cavalleria groſſa,</hi> conſtantly kept on foot, comes to Eighty thouſand: The <hi>Caſſa,</hi> called <hi>per Loccorrenze,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayes the charges for extraordinary emergencies, amounts to One hundred ſixty ſeven thouſand, four hundred and forty. <hi>La Cammera de gli impreſtiti,</hi> or for lending of monies to them who have occaſion for it, is allowed forty thouſand Duckets: Out of the uſe of theſe monies that are lent, the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick makes a purſe of above One hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Duckets: which are commonly laid out to buy Corn to make Biskets for the uſe of the <hi>Armata</hi> or Fleet, and for ſuch other occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as the publick ſervice doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p>And this is all I think fit to be ſaid upon this matter: whence it appears, that though the Republick hath year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57548:39"/>a great income, yet her disburfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are great alſo, to ſupply the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary occaſions of the State; for in time of peace (and not at preſent by reaſon of this charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able War, the expences of which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo certain and ſo regulated as otherwiſe they are) they come at leaſt to three Millions of Duckets, and they lay up ſome Six hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand, or thereabouts, which is a conſiderable ſum, if a juſt account was given of it. But as things uſe to change and alter from what they are at their firſt beginning; ſo it happens to the Republick in this, wherein ſhe receives ſome alteration in the qualities of perſons, and in the fidelity of thoſe who manage their Exchequer; Many Miniſters and Officers of it proving ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther careleſs or unfaithful, applying the publick monies to their particular uſes, relying upon their power and credit, and upon the favour which they ſhew one to another; So that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an intereſt, or of conſanguinity, or ſome other relation, they do not find any ſtrong oppoſition: Beſides that all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57548:39"/>Offices in the Republick, excepting that of the Duke and Procurators of <hi>S. Mark,</hi> being beſtowed but for a time, every one is in hopes of being promoted by the help of his friends and intereſt, whereupon they avoid to make any one their enemies who could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in their deſign: and by theſe means one time or other there is a change in every ones condition, and the multitude of thoſe who are concerned will not allow of an exact and ſtrict inquiring into ſuch things; ſo that this diſorder increaſes every day without hopes of remedy: which in time may happen to cauſe a malignant and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medileſs diſtemper. 'Tis true, that according to the ancient inſtitution of the Republick, they uſe to lay up a certain ſum of monies paid, out of ſome Revenues appointed to that end, in a particular place or treaſure, which in <hi>Venetian</hi> they call <hi>Caſſon Grande,</hi> with this inſcription;</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Quando queſto ſcrinio Sáprirà</l>

               </q>
               <p>Hitherto it hath not been medled with, for all their extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; but 'tis reſerved to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; and as far as I heard ſome few years ago, it was not much above ſix Millions of Gold: which cannot be much increaſed by reaſon of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War, which hath forced them to borrow monies. And this is all, I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay, about the incomes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of this Republick.</p>
               <p>I muſt now ſpeak of her Forces, which do conſiſt in her Armes, and Martial poſture; to the perfection of which, and the obſervation of Military Diſcipline, four wayes are to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſettles that general manner of Education, whereby men are brought up to obedience unto the Laws, and fitted to undergo hardſhip, and other inconveniencies which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57548:40"/>do attend a warlike profeſſion: and which are the grounds of ſtrength and activity, qualities ſo neceſſary to Souldiers. The <hi>Second</hi> ſhews how to make a right choice of Souldiers, a thing very uſeful, ſeeing the diverſity of Climates cauſes ſuch a variety in particular qualifications of Nations; for, let breeding in every Country be what it will, it can never work in a Souldier born in a hot Country, ſuch a ſtrength of body, an undaunted heart, and a not valuing of death, as it will be found in thoſe who are born and brought up in a cold Climate: who on the other ſide will not be ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſo ſubtle, and ſo conſiderate as the former: and he who is born in a temperate Countrey, is thereby diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both to prudence and ſtrength: whence appears the errour of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying, <hi>He who hath Men, hath Souldiers.</hi> Forms cannot be applyed nor imprinted, but according to the diſpoſition of the Matter. The <hi>Third way</hi> gives thoſe orders and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which teach how to arm States with their proportion, and the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57548:41"/>with thoſe Armes which they are fitteſt for, becauſe ſome Nations have greater inclinations and diſpoſitions to be horſemen then to be footmen; ſome are fitter for Land-ſervice them for the Sea: and the very ſorts of Armes, and the way of arming men, are of great concernment, to obſerve good orders, and ſo to do great ſervices. The <hi>Fourth way</hi> doth teach the five Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or Duties of War; namely, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, how to encamp, and fight in the field, how to defend himſelf, and how to beſiege, aſſault, and take ſtrong places. Theſe four wayes are of ſuch a concernment to the greatneſs of an Empire, that though it was otherwiſe ill-regulated in ſome things, the only military Diſcipline being well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and upon good grounds, would be ſufficient to make it ſubſiſt a long time; as by experience it hath been ſeen in every State, but above all, in that Potent <hi>Roman</hi> Common-wealth: which more then any other that ever was, had almoſt every hour the cauſes of her ruine at hand, but the exactneſs and goodneſs of her Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57548:41"/>was a preſent remedy to the diſtempers of that State, and hindered the ſad effects of them.</p>
               <p>And to come to the firſt head, which is the true and right ground of all States; the Republick hath ſetled her Militia, called <hi>Le-Cernide,</hi> upon ſuch manner of Souldiers, as no great ſucceſs is to be expected; not to mention long or old things, the examples of their laſt Wars in <hi>Friuli,</hi> ſhew it: where the Republick having gathered theſe men to offend ſome places, and to defend others, and they not being uſed to hardſhips and inconveniencies of War, before they could be put upon any Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of concernment, diſeaſes got in amongſt them, ſo that only for want of reſt many fell into great diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; inſomuch, that according to the common opinion, either by the ſword or of natural death, there died about thirty thouſand. However, when they are employed in the defence of places, if they enjoy neceſſary conveniencies, and be not reduced to wants and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, they are fit enough to perform their part, better then in the field: Of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57548:42"/>this ſort of Souldiers the Republick hath forty thouſand foot liſted, and could raiſe many more upon occaſion; but as I ſaid, no great hopes are to be conceived of them, they wanting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in that profeſſion: as a thing which they do not apply themſelves to, except upon emergencies; and what they act is out of impetuoſity, more then out of any real courage, or well grounded valour, and they (excepting ſome few) are fitter for the plough then the ſword, eſpecially the <hi>Padoans,</hi> out of which Country the Republick hath many ſuch ones; and this is to be attributed to their natural genius and temper, rather then to any want of exerciſe and care taken of them, for they are often exerciſed and trained up to ſhoot Guns and Muſquets, though their Officers, who take this care upon themſelves, being choſen more by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, then according to merit, know for their part as little of it as others, and they ſtill remam in the ſame paſs: Hence that Common-wealth doth find, how vain 'tis to relie upon an unexperienced multitude of people; So
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57548:42"/>that to ſay the truth, that Republick is more inclined to follow Sea affairs, then thoſe of any other ſort: and from her beginning, and the ſituation of the Chief city, it doth appear that ſhe hath no exact experience of Land bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs: becauſe in their deliberations and counſels about Land-affairs, they are forced to make uſe of ſtrangers for Officers; and that which is of great importance, they muſt lay the ground of all their hopes upon the ſtrength and valour of forreign Souldiers, who often prove to be dangerous, and many times unprofitable. On whom a Prince can never ſettle his Empire up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſure grounds, they being diſunited by reaſon of the ambitious temper of the Nations, which is often attended with unfaithfulneſs. And ſuppoſe they are neither of theſe, yet they will be luſty and ready to commit inſolencies, becauſe neither the deſire to defend a a juſt cauſe, nor any other motive of that nature makes them to be Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; all that they can ſay for it, is a ſhort pay, which not being ſufficient to put them very far upon venturing
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57548:43"/>of their life, often they become ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and diſobedient to their Officers. and upon this account the Republick will ever prefer to live in peace, rather then offend others, for too much truſting to their own Forces: which though they be great, yet they are ſuch in name and opinion, if not more, at leaſt as much, as in reality.</p>
               <p>I ſay further, that with the help of ſome ſtrangers, and by the means of thoſe few light horſemen which they can raiſe out of their own Dominions, they could for a while be maſters of the field; but at laſt they could not keep it. And of this kind of men they could ſet on foot ſomewhat above 6000 light horſemen and muſquetiers of their own Subjects, with ſome ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in part of <hi>Albania</hi> and <hi>Sfaciotti,</hi> as they call them, drawn from the Sea Coaſts and Inland Towns; the former are good enough to rob, to ſcout and interrupt the Convoyes of proviſions for Armies, and even to fall unawares upon the Enemy; but having weak horſes, and themſelves being not well armed, they cannot hold out very
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57548:43"/>long againſt the Enemy; the latter likewiſe are not much worth, only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as they have better horſes then the former, and becauſe alſo they are better men. Nevertheleſs the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick keeps on foot but few Troops of thoſe of <hi>Albania</hi> in time of peace to ſuppreſs the <hi>Banditi,</hi> who gathering ſometimes in a body, do much diſturb the Countrey with their robberies and other oppreſſions: As for the reſt in time of peace, the Republick hath no other body of Souldiers but five troops of Horſe, which are in all 460, and are obliged to keep two horſes a man, whoſe pay is ten Crowns a moneth, which perſons are all alike in this, that none are willing to ſerve, except their priviledges and freedomes be made good to them; notwithſtanding, their horſes are weak and dull, and cannot very long endure hardſhips, being of very little or no account at all.</p>
               <p>Theſe are all the Land Forces of the Republick, which at preſent are not increaſed, except in <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> and the Recruits ſent from time to time to <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi>

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to what we ſaid may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that there are 6000 Cannoniers or Gunners, and others belonging to Artillery, who indeed are ſerviceable men.</p>
               <p>Now I will come to the Sea-forces of this Republick, which I conſider, either as to materials ready fitte and diſpoſed, or in all manner of proviſions, &amp; other things neceſſary for war, as are Souldiers, Ammunition, Armes, and the like. As to the firſt, the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is plentifully provided with every thing neceſſary to ſuch occaſions, as Timber, and all manner of Wood, Iron, Hemp, Pitch, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of every one of theſe there is great ſtore and quantity in the <hi>Arſenal,</hi> placed in a good order:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57548:45"/>Now this <hi>Arſenal</hi> is the moſt ancient, &amp; at preſent the beſt known in the world, without exception or hyperbole; as for the generality and variety of things made in it, ſo for the number and quantity of them, there being no Army, how ſtrong ſoever and great, but it may be ſupplyed thence with all manner of neceſſaries: for in the year 1570, they armed 150 light Gallies, 11 great Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, 1 Galeon, and 25 great ſhips; and of late years 'twas alſo obſerved by experience, when it furniſhed 120 Sails, beſides that vaſt quantity of what remained in it of offenſive and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive armes, which are all placed and diſtributed in an admirable order. This <hi>Arſenal</hi> is in a place ſeparated from the City, compaſſed about with high walls, upon the which are two little Towers, and hath the Sea water round about it; there is but one Gate to go into it, and a channel whereby their ſhipping goes in and out. Within it, for theſe ſix hundred years and above, they have gathered almoſt an infinite number of all ſorts of warlike inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: of gallies, oares, maſts, ſay ls, &amp; all
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57548:46"/>manner of tackling; in the making or preparing of which, are conſtantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed rare and excellent workmen, who have nothing elſe to mind. It is a known ſtory, that when <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> took <hi>Venice</hi> in his way out of <hi>Poland</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> one day whilſt he was at dinner, an handſome and a ſtately Galley was fitted for him to go upon the Sea to take the air: and though two pieces of it, were not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, before he ſate down, as ſoon as he had dined 'twas ready to go out, which ſhews how ready are their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and how quick are their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and nothing was done then, but what could again as eaſily be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon occaſion.</p>
               <p>But to come to ſome particulars of the deſcription of this <hi>Arſenal;</hi> I ſay there are vaſte and ſpacious rooms full of head pieces, breaſt and back pieces, piſtols, muſquets, ſwords, pikes, hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards, partizans, two-handed ſwords, bows, arrows, ſmall guns, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And under theſe rooms are others, which in an excellent and orderly diſpoſition are full of great Guns, half Canons of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57548:46"/>braſs and iron, Culverins, and a vaſt number of Granadoes, Mortar-pieces, and of all manner of Artillery, beſides the great quantity of bullets of iron, of which the Republick hath ſeveral good mines: All the forenamed things are lookt to, by men appointed to that purpoſe, who are not only curious to get into the <hi>Arſenal</hi> all manner of new invented inſtruments of War, but alſo take an extraordinary care of thoſe they have already, which are placed in ſo good an order, that it is a great pleaſure and ſatisfaction to behold it. In a word, they have in this place every neceſſary thing for 150 ſhips, and to arme above 200000 men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that great number of armes, which are in the palace of <hi>St. Mark,</hi> and in the houſes of particular Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whereof they are the pomp and part of their ornaments. But becauſe 'tis not enough for a State to have great ſtore of armes, except there be in it people enough fit to make uſe of them, both out of their natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and experience gotten by the exerciſe of the diſcipline of War, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57548:47"/>except they have good and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Officers to train them to it; So the Republick wanting ſome of theſe things, is put to it when it is needful to get good Souldiers, eſpecially when there is ſome extraordinary occaſion of arming by Land or by Sea, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Land.</p>
               <p>Now I will mention ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars about their Sea affairs: they have a conſtant and ſetled body of a Fleet or Armata of 50 Gallies, which in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights time may be fitted for ſervice with all neceſſary proviſions, ſeeing the <hi>Scuole,</hi> the ſeveral companies and ſecular fraternities are obliged to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh 25 with Rowers, to which end they caſt lots, thereby to know who is to ſerve; ſo that either they muſt go themſelves, or elſe find perſons fit to do ſervice: Alſo all the water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as well thoſe of <hi>Venice,</hi> as others, who go upon the Rivers of the State, are obliged to arm other 25 Gallies, and find Rowers, theſe, as the former, are choſen by lot: But further, the Provinces of <hi>Iſtriá</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia</hi> are to ſet out 12 Gallies more; and before
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57548:47"/>the War, the Iſland of <hi>Candia</hi> was to give 10: which made up a body of 72. In this lies the advantage of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, That ſhe hath the beſt and moſt experienced Galley Souldiers and Rowers of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, becauſe they are almoſt all taken out of the watermen of every Town, who from their childhood are brought up and uſed to this manner of life. So that in this particular the Republick is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well provided; and for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice are conſtantly kept about 2000 men condemned to the Gallies, either their own Subjects, or of others who are ſent to them, or ſlaves. As for the proviſions, they are drawn from the places I named before, of which there is need every year; and this neceſſity is the more increaſed, that Corn is at preſent in the hands of greedy and covetous Noblemen, who take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of occaſions and conjunctures. Of Rice, and all manner of Pulſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary proviſions for their Fleet and Armies, the Republick hath great abundance, becauſe all grows within her Dominions.</p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57548:48"/>
               <p>As to Souldiers, either Subjects of the Republick, or of ſome other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Corſica,</hi> or fugitives from other Dominions, and others who are not <hi>Italians,</hi> as <hi>Germans, French, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, &amp;c.</hi> At firſt they are well enough ſerved by this ordinary Army; but if it be brought to ſuffer much, either by diſeaſes, want of proviſions (which laſt happens very ſeldome) or loſs of ſhips, then the Republick is put to it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as they are alſo when any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Army is to be raiſed: their Subjects as I ſaid already, being not very fit for ſuch ſervices, and ſtrangers being ſo chargeable, not uſed to the climate of <hi>Candia,</hi> and the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> beſides, that in the world there is no power ſo weak, as that which grounds its hopes, and depends upon the will of others: as the Republick hath had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience when ſhe hath made uſe of <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> who are not able to endure the ſcorching heat of the Sun in thoſe hot Countries; beſides the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty there is to get Souldiers of theſe Nations; and when they have with great expences done it, ſometimes are
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57548:48"/>ſallen out diſcontents, diſturbances and mutinies, to the great prejudice of the publick ſervice, to the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience of their own Subjects, and to the general offence of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Venetian</hi> ſhips have uſually ten or twelve pieces of Artillery every one, that is, ten pieces of ſix, with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of fifty, and two of twelve, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the great muſquets of the rowers, of which every Galley hath between 170 and 180, which are well furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with every other thing; but for the foreſaid reaſons, the Republick will ever deſire to be in peace both by Sea and by Land with all her Neighbours, and will ſtand only upon the defenſive, or elſe ſucceſſes will hardly anſwer her expectation; and there is reaſon for it, becauſe offenſive wars are not to be undertaken but by very potent Princes, ſtronger then they whom they offend, at leaſt in the conjuncture they begin the war. This <hi>Venice</hi> knows well, therefore ſhe loves peace, and doth what ſhe can to preſerve it by Art and otherwiſe; and if need be, buys it at a dear rate.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:57548:49"/>
               <p>As 'tis not enough for a State to be ſtrong againſt attempts from without, but they ought to be provided, againſt thoſe which may ariſe within. Three things cauſe alterations and ruine in States and Principalities; one is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the power and violence of enemies, which the <hi>Venetians</hi> are provided againſt by the means of the forces I have already ſpoken of; the other two ariſe from within, and are either the diviſion of Subjects amongſt themſelves, or againſt their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, or elſe the treaſon of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men combining with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the State.</p>
               <p>Theſe diviſions are made and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by factions and parties about matters of Religion, State, or private intereſt, ariſing from errour, ambition, envy, hatred, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Rulers are by all means to put an end to; and above all they are to avoid declaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the head of any party, ſeeing they are all his Subjects, and therefore 'tis contrary to his intereſt, thereby to foment and keep up diviſions within his State. <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:57548:49"/>was by his Enemies forced to make himſelf the head of the League, but the ſecond part was to have ſtript him of his Kingdome, to inveſt therewith one of the Family of <hi>Lorrain:</hi> But here I muſt take notice of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Monarchies over Republicks. When a Republick is ſubject to diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, there is hardly any remedy, but by the deſtruction of one of the parties, whereby the whole is weakned; and if every ſide be potent, they grow ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, which carries them often to extremities, every one thinking his right and his cauſe better then his Neighbours. And 'tis a certain truth, that Common-wealths, and even thoſe Monarchies which have moſt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Republicks, eſpecially thoſe which are elective, were ever more ſubject to troubles and diviſions, then thoſe Dominions which depend upon a ſucceſſive Soveraign: witneſs the <hi>Athenian, Lacedemonian,</hi> and other <hi>Greek</hi> Republicks, and the <hi>Roman</hi> as much as any: which diviſions bring them to ſuch inconveniences as are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the cauſes of their ruine. If in the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57548:50"/>time of the ſecond punick war the <hi>Barchins</hi> had been the maſters of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> in probability <hi>Hannibal</hi> receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſupplyes which he expected from thence, had made himſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſter of <hi>Italy,</hi> which was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by <hi>Hanno</hi>'s faction. Now a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, by all purties being acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be the Lord and Soveraign, by vertue of his Power and Authority, can make up breaches, unite parties, reconcile differences, and take reſolutions, with more ſpeed and ſecreſie.</p>
               <p>However, I do not deny, but that ſuch things (though not ſo eaſily) may be effected in Republicks: eſpecially to make diviſions ceaſe when they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Rulers and the people. Who are apt to raiſe tumults, either for dearth and want of neceſſaries, as bread, or by reaſon of great extorſions made by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Officers, or becauſe they are oppreſſed by forreign enemies, or governed with unreaſonable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable ſeverity: all which things often drive them to deſpair. Therefore to keep people content and quiet, they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57548:50"/>muſt procure them plenty, juſtice, peace, and a certain honeſt liberty, not degenerating into licentiouſneſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe plenty affords men ſubſiſtance and a livelihood, juſtice ſecures ones State, peace promotes both, and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty makes peace ſweet and acceptable: plenty frees one from wants, civil ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice from cheat and deceit; the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal ſecures our perſons from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, peace from the attempts of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Enemies, and liberty from the fear and jealouſie men are apt to have left Princes would encroach upon and deſtroy their priviledges.</p>
               <p>Now the Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> hath ſufficiently provided for every one of theſe things. As to the firſt, which is Plenty, beſides the nature and ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her States, which are fruitful, and have the conveniency of the Sea, and of navigable Rivers, they have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Trade, and Manufactory; So that they have not only that which is neceſſary for life, but alſo the delights and rarities of all parts of the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table world are to be had there; they have alſo ſetled the Office, <hi>Dei prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditori
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57548:51"/>alle biade,</hi> whoſe care it is to ſee that Corn be never wanting in the City. As for juſtice and liberty they are well ſecured, as it will appear from what I am to ſay afterwards.</p>
               <p>Now as to monies, this being the firſt aliment, and the right ſinew of war; and as a State hath two things to do, to make war, the one is to raiſe men and put them in a body, and the other to ſend them where occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; but neither of theſe can be done without monies, which yet muſt laſt, becauſe the manner of carrying on wars doth require it; and ſeeing there are two wayes of managing it, either when men come to decide it with a battel as ſoon as can be done, and then all lyes at the ſtake, 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary as to pay the arrears of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, ſo to encourage them alſo, and in a doubtful caſe to beſtow ſome libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity upon them: or if war be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and ſlowly carried on, with an intent to tire, waſte and conſume the Enemy; this manner of war, more then the former, doth wholly depend upon the abundance of monies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57548:51"/>Souldiers are duly paid, and the Army ſupplyed with all manner of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary proviſions. Indeed the riches of this Republick are very great; not only the Publick, but alſo the private, firſt, by reaſon of the large extent of her Dominions both by Land and by Sea, wherein are great, plentiful and populous Cities which yield very great Revenues, as hath been ſhewed before; by which means ſhe may lead Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers where occaſion doth require, making War to laſt when 'tis her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſo to do; whereunto I add, that the Republick hath means and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions enough to find out monies, as we expreſſed before. Moreover, if ever the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility were rich, they are now, and in a high degree, whereof there are ſeveral cauſes. Firſt, in all <hi>Italy</hi> there is not a City more Merchant then <hi>Venice</hi> is, there being in it at leaſt fifty very rich Merchants. Then, the conveniency of the Sea brings to them a great Trade from the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> and (in time of peace) fills the City with rich wares, with a notable advantage of cuſtomes to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57548:52"/>Revenue, and to particular men; and becauſe of the long Peace which they had with the <hi>Turks</hi> before the breaking forth of the preſent war, both publick and private men had time to gather great means: 'Tis no wonder therefore, if in conſideration of this, the Republick is at preſent ſo ſolicitous, and ſo willing to have Peace with the <hi>Turk,</hi> that war being a prejudice to all in it; it not only hinders them from gathering, but alſo forces them to lay out what they had before.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak of the riches of the Nobility of <hi>Venice,</hi> they are very great, and almoſt ineſtimable upon theſe two accounts: firſt, of all the beneficial and gainful charges of the Republick are diſtributed amongſt them; and the other is, that having bent all their thoughts upon the gain and profit in the Land, they have a hand in the management of all the Chief Affairs in it, there being none ſo fit and ſo able as the Nobles; and they are very ſubtle to get thereby all the advantage they can, and yet with ſo much dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, that people cannot handſomly
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57548:52"/>complain of them, it being an <hi>Italian</hi> ſaying, That Governours within the State of the Church do cheat <hi>with zeal and devotion;</hi> Thoſe under other Princes <hi>with authority and bravery,</hi> but the Noble <hi>Venetians with dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> yet for all this, ſome are poor, but theſe are very few in compariſon of the reſt; and to theſe alſo the Republick takes care to give ſome Offices, that however they may not want: For all this, I know for certain, that ſome of them uſe to go up and down into <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berghi,</hi> or places where ſtrangers lodge, to beg. Indeed forrainers, who are not acquainted with the perſons, are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to ſee men come in to them in the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> habit, which is a long black Gown hanging upon the ground, and the <hi>Berrotta</hi> or Cap (for they wear no hat.) One pretends to ask for a Gentleman lodged in the houſe, who, ſaith he, promiſed to lend me ſo much; then ſeeming to be troubled, he proffers a Ring with <hi>Venetian</hi> ſtones, or the like, to be pawned for much more then it is worth; and if this takes not, then he refers himſelf to the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57548:53"/>Gentleman, to lend him or give him what he pleaſes: and a ſtranger, who is dazzled with that name of a <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobleman, doth hardly know how to be rid of him, without giving him ſomething; the onely way being to tell him, take heed what you do, for I belong to ſuch an Ambaſſadour: after which he departs immediately, becauſe under pain of death, no <hi>Venetian</hi> Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may keep company with any one belonging to a forrain Miniſter. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Noblemen, but a <hi>Greek</hi> by Nation, comes directly and begs, pretending to have loſt all by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Turkiſh</hi> war: Theſe two (the only preſidents in that kind) are exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of poverty in that order; but they are alſo the ſhame of the Nobility, the reſt being provided for, as I already expreſſed. I could here come to ſome particulars about the manner of the Nobility, of the proceeding with the Subjects, of their manners, cuſtomes and qualities, but of this another time; at preſent I intend to ſay few things of their publick Treaſure.</p>

               <p>As to the particular ſum of monies which the Republick may have, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well known, the preſent <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh</hi> war having much exhauſted them, and the ſupplies which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from ſome few Princes, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Perſons, have been very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, comparing them with their occaſions. On the other ſide, 'tis true, that the monies which they have ſpent, either in the pay of Souldiers or Proviſions, and ammunition for the Fleets and Land Forces, hath been like the circular blood, and not gone out of their State, which (except ſome Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) hath afforded them all neceſſary proviſions for war. 'Tis a common opinion, that before this war (for to ſpeak a certainty of theſe things, one muſt conſider the Republick in peace, and a ſetled condition) the publick treaſure could amount to fifteen Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>llions of Gold, and not more, becauſe every year there were extraordinary occaſions of laying out much money, ſometimes in one place, and ſometimes in another, not only for the Service of their own States, but alſo for the uſe
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57548:54"/>of other: ſo they furniſhed the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> with ſixty thouſand Crowns a moneth; and they did lend ſomething in the wars of <hi>Bohemia:</hi> but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent war hath forced them to borrow monies upon uſe, from ſome of their own Merchants, and of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and they have been put to coyning of braſs and coper, which formerly was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden amongſt them; and at preſent they allow of the Gold and Silver Coynes, not only of other Brinces of <hi>Italy,</hi> but the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> are currant in the City. There was alſo above One Million of falſe coyn, which was taken in from the Subjects, without giving them any ſatisfaction for it, which they ſince have made uſe of, So that from all this one may judge. that the publick Treaſure is not ſo great as hath been, and is ſtill talk't of, people uſually looking upon ſuch things through a multiplying Glaſs: It is true, that there is ſtill a very rich Treaſure in <hi>St. Mark</hi> (and this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly that which is called the Treaſury of <hi>Venice,</hi> and not a Treaſure in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as many do imagine) which I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57548:54"/>have ſeen ſeveral time; it conſiſts in work of Gold well wrought, and in Jewels and precious Stones of very great value, and of an extraordinary beauty, which comes behind no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The particulars are, firſt, the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Crown, wherewith every new Duke is Crowned, all ſet with jewels of very great value; then twelve Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelets of maſſy Gold of an indifferent bigneſs, all full as can be of Emerald ſtones, and Saphires, which were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at the taking of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> and there are twelve golden Crowns of an extraordinary beauty, and full of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, taken in the ſame City: further, two very fair Crowns of gold, all ſet with Jewels, the one for the Kingdom of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the other for that of <hi>Candia;</hi> there are alſo ſome Carbun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of an extraordinary bigneſs, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phirs, Turkoiſes ſtones, Granets, and other precious ſtones of a rare beauty and value, beſides ſome Cenſor pans, a papal golden Cup, with the Chalice, and other rare works admirable to look upon; there are ſome houſehold
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57548:55"/>ſtuff, and works of antiquity, of all manner of ancient Armes, as breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates, which anciently the Princes uſed to carry to war when they went in perſon; Halbards after the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> way, Rapiers, two hundred Swords, Pikes, great croſs-Bows, with ſome other preſents given to the Republick by the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and other Princes of the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> with ſome other Tokens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Genoa, Germany,</hi> from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and other Nations; of all which things three rooms of a good bigneſs are ſtored: But the rareſt of all theſe things is the workmanſhip of a wooden horſe, between the legs of an armed man, an excellent invention, and wonderfully fair; and this is all which is to be found there moſt magnifick, moſt fair, and moſt rare; for I do not ſo much as take notice of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pretended Relicks, which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to ſuperſtition, more then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
               <p>And here upon the ſubject of Riches, I muſt take notice of a queſtion ſtarted by State-men, whether Riches or Poverty, do beſt qualifie Subjects?
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57548:55"/>that is, whether it be better for a Prince that his Subjects be rich, or that they be poor? To which I anſwer, That extremities are very dangerous; and firſt, for thoſe ſubjects who are extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarly rich, they are apt to be proud, ambitious, and given to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and vices; all which things are dangerous in Monarchies and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths, eſpecially if they be any wayes diſaffected and popular; ſo that if they do any good action, it is to be ſuſpected they do it for their private ends and deſigns, more then for the publick good: Upon theſe grounds Princes do ſuſpect them ſo, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meerly upon jealouſie of State, they are kept low, and undone; for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times Supream Authority is not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with this only, that one will do no harm, but it requires alſo that he have not the power to do it, the great intention being to diſenable him from it; Rulers not being ſo ſolicitous of what a man will do, as of what he can do. Thus it falls out with high Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar trees, to be ſtrucken with thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps, whilſt low ſhrubs are free and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57548:56"/>ſafe. Should a Star ſhine as bright and as glorious as the Sun, it would be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a prodigy; ſo in States, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Monarchies, there ought to be a greater difference between the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign and the firſt of Subjects, then between this and the laſt of the people; for what greater light the former hath he borrows and receives it from his Prince, who is the fountain of Honour, and who can make him as low, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf or his Anceſtors made him high. Now the greateſt men in Kingdomes are but Subjects, as the loweſt of the people, and between them there is only a difference in degree, or at the moſt in order; and it is eaſier for one to paſs from a low degree of ſubjection to a higher one, then from the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſubjection to paſs to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty; only ſome mitigation of this muſt be made for thoſe who are Heirs apparent, and (if they live) infallible ſucceſſors of the Crown, yet till then they are but Subjects.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, this greatneſs of ſome particular man is more dangerous in Republicks then in Monarchies, for the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57548:56"/>Glory of <hi>Sylla, Marius, Craſſus, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius, Caeſar,</hi> and others, proved very fatal to the <hi>Roman Republick,</hi> more then that abſolute Authority which <hi>Sejanus</hi> uſurped to himſelf, was to <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> in his abſence, though for a while the Emperours Authority was eclipſed by the glory and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that favourite. Neither is it very proper that ſome Families ſhould enjoy more riches and credit then the Republicks wherein they live, as it hath been, and at this day it is in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa;</hi> but this may be attributed to the ſeveral revolutions and changes which have befallen that Republick, for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Common-wealths have been, and are more careful then ſo: Thus at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> though rewards be given to thoſe who have done well, yet the great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and reputation of all comes to the State, and doth not ſtay nor fix in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men. But the jealouſie of the Common-wealth of <hi>Athens,</hi> went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all this; for they denied <hi>Miltiades,</hi> a Crown of green leaves (an uſual thing amongſt the <hi>Romans</hi>) after that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and immortal Victory of his at
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57548:57"/>
                  <hi>Marathon;</hi> One of the Senators ſtood up and ſaid to him, <hi>When thou</hi> Miltia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des <hi>fighting alone ſhalt have obtained Victory of our Enemies, then thou ſhalt alone be honoured:</hi> And this jealouſie of theirs introduced the <hi>Oſtraciſme</hi> into their Republick, whereby any particular man who far exceeded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in riches or credit, was for ten years exiled out of the City; ſeverity, which though it ſeems to ſecure them from troubles and alterations, yet it doth really diſcourage vertue and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: for take away from vertue reward of honour or riches, ſhe loſes much of her life and ſtrength, <hi>Langueſcit ſine praemio virtus.</hi> This extremity is not ſo eaſily found in Monarchies, neither do I ſee how it may conſiſt with ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, becauſe ſome men are very great in a State, that meerly upon ſuſpition they ſhould be deprived of what riches and honours their Anceſtours merit and vertue, or their own, have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with, except indeed they would turn the courſe of them againſt their Spring, and make uſe of them for wrong ends, and contrary to thoſe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57548:57"/>for which they were given; yet in all this the State and Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority muſt find their ſafety.</p>
               <p>Now to the ſecond extremity, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be better for a State that all the ſubjects of it ſhould be kept low and poor? I will omit particular cuſtomes and conſtitutions of ſome Countries, grounded upon their manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and temper of the people, to come to a general, and I think a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <hi>Rule;</hi> I ſay therefore, that to oppreſs people who are Obedient to Authority, meerly to keep them poor and low, or under pretence of taking from them the means and occaſions of troubles and ſeditions, is a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful, unjuſt, and unſafe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, unmerciful. One of the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters which Scripture gives of a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man is, that he is merciful to the beaſt, which God was pleaſed not only to have ſome reſpect to, when he preſcribed the obſervation of the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> but alſo to take a ſpecial care of, when he forbids his people, <hi>Not to muzzle the Oxe which treads the Corn,</hi> becauſe he ought to have ſome fruit of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57548:58"/>his labours; much more is God mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of men, created all of one and the ſame lump, after his own Image and likeneſs; therefore the Son of God commands us to be merciful, even as our Heavenly Father is merciful, who cauſes his Sun to ſhine upon all men, and ſends his rain for the benefit of all. Tenderneſs is becoming Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Rulers, who muſt be fathers and protectors of the people, knowing alſo they have a Lord and a Maſter in Heaven, who is no excepter of perſons; therefore in thoſe things they exact from ſubjects they ought to conſider their ſtrength and abilities, ſo as not to require brick where there is no ſtraw, and not inflict upon them a greater curſe then that which God pronounced in the beginning, <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat thy bread;</hi> Indeed according to this, they muſt work hard to have it, but what a crying ſin is it after they have as it were ſweated out their heart, to deprive them of the end and benefit of their labours, which was to get bread in the ſweat of their face; this is to be neither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> nor Chriſtian.</p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:57548:58"/>
               <p>But I muſt ſhew how unjuſt this is; for though men are to pay Tributes, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and indeed till the laſt farthing of their purſe, and the laſt drop of their blood, to contribute to the relief of the neceſſities of the State; yet extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſions ceaſing, in juſtice they ought to be eaſed of their burthens, for the cauſe ceaſing the effect muſt alſo ceaſe: And in all ſorts of ranks and qualities, there is a right of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, which if you take away, all the world ſhall go up-ſide down; there is that <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> which ought to be preſerved to every one. If Princes do give way to the diſturbance of the propriety of the Subject, unawares they may happen to give preſidents, and lay a foundation of deſtroying in time their own right and prerogative. When the <hi>Rubicon</hi> is once paſt, and men are engaged in a wrong way, there is no end, and things may go much further then they thought at firſt they could go; and this ſhews the danger of ſuch practiſes. Furthermore, there ought to be a difference between ſubjects and ſlaves: the former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57548:59"/>upon Laws, and the latter upon the will and fancies of men, not only as to goods, if any they have, but alſo as to their perſons and lives, yet this is only amongſt <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Barbarians.</hi> Now when a man engages himſelf to be a ſervant to another, it is upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conditions ſo tollerable as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, not to give his Maſter an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and deſpotick power over his goods and perſon; this ſame conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt be ſuppoſed to have been had by thoſe who firſt of all freely and willingly ſubmitted to Authority, yet ſtill with this vaſte difference, that men are ſervants by their choice, but ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by birth and nature; ſo that one may not be a ſervant, but of unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able neceſſity he is a Subject; and ſo with ſtricter bonds tyed to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, more then any ſervant is to his maſter: however this ſhews what I ſaid, That there ought to bounds and limits to the ſufferings and burthens of ſubjects, as all created things have without exception, the will and power of God alone being boundleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:57548:59"/>
               <p>Neither is it ſafe for States to keep ſubjects exceeding low and poor, for people are thereby reduced to wants and to deſpair, which put them upon any extremities; they are apt to raiſe Tumults and Seditions; for nothing in the world ſpurs on men ſo much as want and neceſſity do. Men who have nothing to loſe care not what they do, but will ſeek to fiſh in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters, for they are ſure to loſe nothing but a poor life, which may be they are weary of; and they are in hopes (perhaps not without probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) of getting ſomething. That State is in a dangerous condition whoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are in great poverty, not only by reaſon of the diſturbance which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may ariſe within, but alſo becauſe upon occaſion no great help can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them againſt a forreign Enemy, the Rulers having already loſt the hearts of the people, who have no purſe to aſſiſt them, nor hardly hands to lend, poverty taking away the heart and the ſpirit of men, whereby they are unreſolved, wanting experience and capacity to do any ſervice; ſo that
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57548:60"/>the Prince alone, or very weakly aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, muſt curb troubles within, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hoſtilities from without, for the moſt part theſe ſort of ſubjects being like fit-ſick folk a bed, who think to eaſe themſelves by often turnings and changings of place. <hi>Rehoboams</hi> words, <hi>My father chaſtiſed you with whips, but I will chaſtiſe you with Scorpions,</hi> coſt him very dear, ſeeing he loſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Ten Tribes: which God forbid I ſhould ſpeak as to the <hi>right</hi> but only as to the <hi>matter of fact,</hi> knowing alſo there was a ſpecial hand of God in it; but to my mind, this makes the danger of this practice very palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Therefore the ſafety and proſperity of a State doth conſiſt in a middle way between two extremities; that is, in a mediocrity of means and riches of ſubjects; and theſe queſtionleſs are the ſtrength of a Nation, who are not ſo rich, ſo credited, nor ſo ſtrong of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to oppreſs others, or attempt any thing againſt the Government, or ſo poor as to undertake any thing to get bread, or to ſeek their fortune in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57548:60"/>the troubles and ruines of the State, ſeeing they have enough of their own to live upon, according to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they are afraid to loſe, and would not hazzard upon any uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, it being a great folly in a man who ventures to loſe more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably he can gain; and certainly the more theſe means or riches are diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the better and ſafer it is for the State and the Publick, for ſo every one hath ſomething, and none hath enough to cauſe, or reaſon to wiſh for diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances: being a counterpoiſe one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and every one having ſome ground of ſatisfaction, and content, though ſome more, and ſome leſs; there is no danger that the lean Kine ſhall devour the fat, nor ſhall the fat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the lean. This truth is confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the wiſe man, <hi>Give me neither Poverty nor Riches;</hi> the firſt, to the end I do not ſteal; and the laſt, <hi>that I grow not proud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſpoken of the Riches of the Republick, I muſt in the next place diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of her Government, and of the Order of her Councils. The Prince, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57548:61"/>
                  <hi>Doge,</hi> or <hi>Duke,</hi> is the head of the Republick: who though he hath the Name of Prince, yet he hath no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority without the Council: he may not ſo much as open a publick Letter without one of the ſix Councellours, neither doth he keep a Court as other Princes, but only a handſome Family: He is ever in a Dukal dreſs, and in ſuch cloaths as make him appear venerable; He wears a Cap, which behind riſeth up like a horn, or if I may ſo call it, a crimſon kind of Mitre, with a gold border, and a thin Coiſe under it; his upper Garment is like a cloak hanging down to the ground; He hath on his ſhoulders <hi>Ermin</hi> skins, which hang round about him to his middle, and are cloſed before with precious ſtones; about his Waſte he wears a rich em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered girdle, ſet with many Jewels of great price; the Bells of <hi>St. Mark</hi> ring when he goes out of his Palace, and before him are carried ſome little ſpread flags, and alſo are ſounded ſome ſilver Trumpets of an extraordinary bigneſs; then are carried the Cuſhion, and the golden chair, after follows the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57548:61"/>Prince under the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrellon</hi> or <hi>Paraſol</hi> inſtead of a <hi>Canopy,</hi> between two of the Chief Ambaſſadours who are preſent; laſt of all come a matter of thirty ranks, of two in a rank, of Noblemen, all cloathed in Red; and he who is at the right hand of the firſt rank, bears the Sword naked in his hand; and this is done when he marches in State.</p>
               <p>So then the whole Authority of this Government doth depend upon ſome certain Noble Families; which almoſt from the beginning of the Republick were united together, and to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeveral occaſions others have been added; ſo there hath been ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Nobility, when by reaſon of ſome wars the door into it hath been open to ſome Families, who though they exceeded others in riches, yet were very ſhort of them in Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of blood, and extraction; Hence have ſprung ſome Emulations or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyings of one againſt another, as 'tis expreſſed in their Baloting or voting, whereby ſometimes are named to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, not they who have moſt merit, but they who have moſt friends, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57548:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>moſt favour; but theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen every where elſe. Becauſe I will draw no inference to diſparage either their Perſons or their Government, it being natural to every one to promote his friends and relations, rather then an enemy or a ſtranger: All theſe Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies may be reduced to the number of 150, which make up about 3000 Noblemen of all Qualities and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, out of whom are choſen the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiglieri</hi> in this manner.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is the <hi>Gran Conſiglio,</hi> the Great Council, which is the Aſſembly of all the <hi>Venetian</hi> Nobility, from 25 years of age upwards: But firſt, it is neceſſary for one to prove he is ſo many years old, to which effect he preſents himſelf to the <hi>Avogadori di Commune;</hi> and the Oath of the Parents, and of the next relations, is taken to confirm he is 25 years Old; then there muſt be two credible witneſſes to affirm that he is ſuch a Noblemans Son, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he may go into the Great Council: there are alſo ſome few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Nobility, who may be preſent at this Council, after they are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57548:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>21 years Old, which they obtain by lot in this manner. It is the cuſtome on St. <hi>Barbara</hi>'s day, in remembrance of a great Victory obtained upon that day, for all thoſe young Nobles who are entred into the 21 year of their age, to give in their names, which are put in a box, out of which ſome are taken and put into another with the Golden Balls, and he whoſe name is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out is made of the Council, and the reſt, whoſe number is ſometimes greater and ſometimes leſſer, muſt ſtay till another year. Now this <hi>Gran Conſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi> is the baſis and foundation of the Republick; in it are created all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, not onely of the City of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> but alſo of the whole State: it commonly conſiſts of 1500 Noblemen, who meet uſually every Sunday, and almoſt every Holy day.</p>
               <p>Then follows the Council called <hi>Pregadi,</hi> which is one of the Chief members of the Republick, for in it are treated of, and decided, all the great affairs of the State; it conſiſts of 120 Noblemen, of whom ordinarily five may be of one Family; beſides ſome
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57548:63"/>other Councils and Magiſtrates, ſome whereof have right of <hi>Balloting</hi> (or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in their Votes by way of Balls) &amp; others have it not, only they may hear what paſſes there: Therefore they who enter into this Council are firſt the <hi>Doge;</hi> the ſix <hi>Conſiglieri,</hi> the <hi>Conſiglio di dieci,</hi> the <hi>Avogadori,</hi> all the <hi>Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori,</hi> the <hi>Quarantia Criminale,</hi> the <hi>three Conſiglieri dà baſſo,</hi> the two <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſori,</hi> the three <hi>Sopra gli atti,</hi> the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pragaſtaldi,</hi> the three Governours <hi>dell'entrale,</hi> the three Lords <hi>Soprà le biade,</hi> the four Lords <hi>over the Salt,</hi> the three Chamberlains <hi>di Commune,</hi> the three Lords of the <hi>Raggioni Vecchie,</hi> the three of <hi>the Raggioni nuove,</hi> the three <hi>Proveditori di Commune,</hi> the three Lords <hi>over the Arſenal,</hi> the three <hi>prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditori ſopra le Camere,</hi> the three <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeri delli dieci Savi,</hi> and the three <hi>Cattaveri,</hi> or inquiſitors of truth. All theſe names I ſet down in <hi>Italian,</hi> there being hardly in <hi>Engliſh</hi> any to expreſs them, but hereafter I will make out how they are to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have no vote in <hi>Pregadi</hi> are the Colledge of the <hi>Savii,</hi> the three
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57548:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>Delle Sanità</hi> over the health, the three over <hi>li daci,</hi> gabels or cuſtomes, the <hi>Proviſori</hi> over the <hi>Coſtimo</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> the three over that of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and the twelve over that of <hi>Candia;</hi> all theſe together make up the Council of <hi>Pregadi,</hi> which meets whenſoever it pleaſes the <hi>Collegio,</hi> and the Bell rings when they are to meet; they are alſo called to it by publick Officers, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to that effect. This <hi>Pregadi</hi> may take no reſolution, except there be in it four <hi>Conſigliori,</hi> and at leaſt ſixty of the Noblemen who have Vote, to make <hi>a Quorum:</hi> All matters of great concernment to the Republick, are treated of, in this Council: namely, the reſolutions about Peace, War or Truce, Leagues and Confederacies, of the wayes of raiſing monies, of giving aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to Princes, of making new Laws, chuſing new Generals, and high Officers of the Fleet, and Army, and of the electing the <hi>Savi of the Land, of the Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Savi Grandi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But becauſe I ſpeak here of ſeveral Offices under <hi>Italian</hi>-names, for indeed ſome of them cannot be rendred into
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57548:64"/>
                  <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I muſt now explain in few words what ſome of them are, and hereafter I ſhall have occaſion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion others; There are the <hi>Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori di S. Marco,</hi> which is one of the greateſt and the moſt honourable dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of the Republick, for they are ſuch for life, they take care of the Church and Treaſure of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> they ſee that the Wills of Teſtators be put in execution by their Heirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves Commiſſioners of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies, they are allowed to wear the Dukal Veſt, and to have ſome few ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to attend them; they take place of all Magiſtrates, except the ſix <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiglieri,</hi> and the three <hi>Capi di Quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and have a particular lodging al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them by the Publick, or ſixty Duckets by the year: They all enter into <hi>Pregadi,</hi> and three of them into the Council <hi>di Dieci,</hi> by which they are choſen. Formerly they were but two, then three, and thence twelve, but now there are twenty five, ſome having gotten the place by ſtrength of mouſes. They never go into the <hi>Gran Conſiglio,</hi> but when a Duke is to be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57548:64"/>choſen, and uſually they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any other place but that of <hi>Savi Grandi,</hi> though ſometimes upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſions they be admitted into others.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Conſiglieri</hi> are ſix in number, and to underſtand this one muſt know that the City of <hi>Venice</hi> is divided into two parts; The one on this ſide <hi>Rial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> and the other on that ſide: Every ſide hath three <hi>Seſſiori</hi> quarters or parts, for every one of which a <hi>Conſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liero</hi> is choſen by the <hi>Gran Conſiglio,</hi> three at one time, and that is once of one ſide of <hi>Rialto,</hi> and the next time on the other: which dignity is but for one year.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Pregadi</hi> comes from <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gati,</hi> prayed to, or wiſhed and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for when <hi>Venice</hi> was divided into petty Iſlands, one of every place was prayed to go and give his advice about publick affairs: This Council doth chuſe Ambaſſadours to be ſent to Princes, with whom ever goes a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary taken from amongſt the people, without whoſe knowledge the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour muſt do nothing of publick
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57548:65"/>concernment, and before this ſame <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadi,</hi> Ambaſſadours after their return home make Relations of the Courts whence they come. To enter into it one muſt be at leaſt thirty years old: Of the 120 that compoſe it, ſixty are named by the <hi>Pregadi,</hi> and other ſixty by the great Council: Every one of thoſe who have Vote in it name one, he who hath moſt votes remains in it: However, as this Council doth confirm or reject Laws made by other Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſo in point of the Election of a <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> which is the greateſt of all Military charges, the great Council muſt approve or diſapprove of him whom the <hi>Pregadi</hi> hath choſen: There enters alſo into this a ſort of men who lend monies to the Republick untill they be paid again; in which privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their Children ſucceed, not to Vote, but onely to hear what paſſes therein; And this hath been to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men to lend monies in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent War againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary meeting of this Council depends upon the <hi>Collegio,</hi> but uſually 'tis thrice a week, and alwayes in the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57548:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>afternoon, and ſo they paſs the whole night if buſineſſes do require it. In <hi>Venice</hi> they have a Law made by the <hi>Cenſors</hi> and approved by <hi>Pregadi</hi> and <hi>Gran Conſiglio,</hi> that when a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath obtained a charge from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two Councils, no body muſt go to their lodgings to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with them, nor publickly in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Collegio</hi> or Colledge, which is the third member of the Republick, is in great eſteem, and of high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: It doth conſiſt of ſixteen perſons, of ſix <hi>Savi Grandi,</hi> five <hi>Savi di Terra,</hi> and five <hi>di Mare:</hi> Theſe laſt take care of all Sea affairs concerning Peace or War: the others do mind Land affairs of Peace or War, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they are obliged to keep an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the liſted Land Forces of the Republick; but the <hi>Savi Grandi</hi> take care of all buſineſſes both by Sea and Land, who indeed do almoſt govern the whole Republick; all buſineſſes of Peace and War do paſs through their hands; they write to Princes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Anſwers: therefore none

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57548:67"/>which requires ſpeed; which things, if they were to be debated and reſolved upon, firſt by the Colledge, then in <hi>Pregadi,</hi> that diligence, and may be that ſecriſie which are neceſſary, could not be obtained.</p>
               <p>There is the <hi>Conſiglio</hi> only and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of ten, and the <hi>Conſiglio con l'ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giunto,</hi> double, and with the additional; in the former are onely the ten perſons forenamed, and beſides them come into the laſt, the <hi>Savi grandi,</hi> and thoſe <hi>di terra,</hi> the three <hi>Avegadori,</hi> nine of the <hi>Procuratori,</hi> and fifteen others who are appointed for that purpoſe; the former ſits almoſt once every day, but the latter once in eight dayes, which time hath been prefixed within theſe two laſt centuries of years to ſettle the minds of people who were mightily ſtirred and affraid when this Council uſed to meet, it being known that it is only upon buſineſſes of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as to puniſh Rebels and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours to the Republick, falſe Coyners, and exceſſes of another nature, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation of their Churches, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within theſe very few years upon this occaſion.</p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:57548:67"/>
               <p>One day a young Gentleman of the Family <hi>Nani,</hi> lately come from abroad, having met with (whether it was by accident, or with a premeditated de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign 'tis not known) the wife of the <hi>Signiore Giovanni Grimani</hi> within a Church in a remote part of the City, ſomething paſſed between them, it may be nothing but words; but however the thing was miſ-repreſented to the <hi>Prior</hi> or <hi>Superiour</hi> of the <hi>Cloyſter</hi> by one of the <hi>Priors,</hi> who reported he had ſeen ſomething unbecoming the place; this hare-brain'd <hi>Prior,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any conſideration of the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in a paſſionate fit went and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to the Council of Ten, that ſome obſcene act had been committed in their Church by ſuch perſons; whereupon immediately the Council ſent the Gentleman a Warrant to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before it within twenty four hours, and give an account of ſuch things; but he having conſulted with his friends, thought fit to let this fury be over, and therefore abſented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but the Council who firſt of all is hot upon buſineſſes, (a thing indeed

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57548:69"/>upon the Lady, and conſequently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Family; On the other ſide the Lady muſt be made away with poyſon; the firſt failed, but the ſecond did not, although the Husband was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, yet the <hi>Abbot,</hi> as they ſay, undertook to cure her of all diſeaſes, and with a Pill to ſend her into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, which was effected in a fortnights time. In the mean while <hi>Nani</hi> and his friends were not aſleep, for the Ladies Husband was quickly ſent by poyſon, as it is thought, pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after his wife; and a while after when the brunt was over, <hi>Nani</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared before the <hi>Conſiglio:</hi> who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard of his juſtification abſolved him, too late indeed as we uſe to ſay, <hi>After death comes the Phyſician.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This <hi>Conſiglio</hi> manages alſo certain ſums of mouies as they are aſſigned to it, hath an abſolute power over the Artillery, and all Officers belonging to it: It hath alſo in the <hi>Arſenal</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Gallies at his command, which are marked with theſe two letters, <hi>C. X.</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Capi,</hi> or <hi>Conſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> and the ſecond letter <hi>X.</hi> maketh
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57548:70"/>Ten, or <hi>di dieci.</hi> When Princes have a mind to treat ſecretly with the Republick, they direct their Letters thus; <hi>To the Sereniſſime Prince,</hi> N.

When a guilty man is brought before this <hi>Conſiglio,</hi> he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no Council, nor any one to plead for him, but one of the <hi>Conſiglio</hi> muſt do it, for him, or elſe it will not be done at all: There is no appeal from their Sentence, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed by none but by themſeves, or their ſucceſſours, for they are changed every year, the Duke excepted; this ſeverity and great authority makes it formidable to the City.</p>
               <p>Upon the ſubject of this <hi>Conſiglio di dieci,</hi> it is to be obſerved, that the three <hi>Capi di</hi> 40 are otherwiſe called <hi>Conſiglieri dà baſſo,</hi> and that the ſix <hi>Conſiglieri Grandi</hi> are in charge but eight months, that is, in their aſſiſting with the Duke, and the four months following, by three and three, they are <hi>Conſiglieri dà baſſo,</hi> that is in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia:</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57548:70"/>ſo that thus they end the year of their <hi>Conſiglierato</hi> or Council-ſhip. And the three <hi>Capi</hi> are not taken out of the old <hi>Quarantia,</hi> nor out of the new, but out of the Criminal, which all are called <hi>Quarantie,</hi> becauſe in every one of them are forty Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. All theſe things are neceſſary for forrain Miniſters to that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, to be known by them, that they may accordingly make their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and this at all times hath been a great help to the diſpatch of very difficult and important affairs. But I muſt come to another head.</p>
               <p>The Adminiſtration of Juſtice is wholly committed to the Noble <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> who are ſent into all Cities, Towns and Burroughs to govern them under the title of <hi>Podeſtá:</hi> theſe have a Supream Authority both in Civils and Criminals: their Courts conſiſting of one Vicar, of one judge <hi>all' male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio</hi> againſt Crimes and Delinquents; another Judge <hi>alle vettoa aglie,</hi> about Victuals and Proviſions; and another <hi>all' Aouija,</hi> who are Doctors at Law of the State. To the Rectors of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57548:71"/>are ſubject all other Governours of Towns, Caſtles and Villages, who have Authority in the Civil; but over the criminal it is extended only to the rope they call <hi>Strapado, Baniſhment, Priſon,</hi> to the <hi>Galley,</hi> and to ſome <hi>pecuniary fine,</hi> but not to death, which is belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Governours of Cities. So that the chief charges of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Republick are within all her Dominions beſtowed upon the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility (excepting <hi>Breſcia,</hi> which hath it otherwiſe by a ſpecial priviledge) and the Subjects may riſe no higher then to be made Governours of ſome Lands, or ſome ſtrong places, becauſe the Republicks cuſtome is to employ ſtrangers, rather then their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and in the choice made of thoſe Nobles there is a great deal of corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption; for capacity, age, experience, integrity of life, merits and vertue are not ſo much look't upon, as the riches, intereſt and dependancies of the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and whether the perſon be able to render ſome ſervice to thoſe who fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him in his Election; And this is an univerſal practice all the world
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57548:71"/>over, to carry out things by way of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, parties, bribes, and intereſt.</p>
               <p>As for the Lawes, every City is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned according to her own Statutes and Cuſtomes, ſo that except by Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Readers in the Schools, there is no mention made of the Civil <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Imperial</hi> Lawes; and what is read in theſe Schools (at <hi>Padoa</hi> eſpecially) is more for ſhew and oſtentation, and to bear up the credit of the place, then for any uſe and obſervation of them: For the Republick within this century of years, hath taken away not onely the Authority, but alſo the very name of <hi>Imperial,</hi> or any other name rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> out of her State, and hath deprived the people of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; of creating Notaries, of Knighting, Legitimating, Naturali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and the like. It is alſo forbidden to Notaries to uſe the name as <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> or <hi>Royal:</hi> So that all things are done by the Name and Authority of <hi>Venice,</hi> it being their pleaſure, that upon all occaſions of High Juſtice, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Honours, the Lawes of the Cities, and places, and ſometimes of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57548:72"/>
                  <hi>Venice</hi> her ſelf, be obſerved in all places.</p>
               <p>As to the manner of their judiciary proceedings, things are judged and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided according to a long cuſtome and experience of many years, more then out of any learning gotten by ſtudies; ſeeing the Nobility of <hi>Venice,</hi> not only doth not follow the ſtudy of the Law, but alſo they think it were a ſhame for them to do it; ſo that inſtead of it they learn a little of Phyloſophy, and ſomething of Rhetorick, whereby they are enabled to make diſcourſes upon occaſion; and this I ſay as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality, there being amongſt them perſons of a deep and Univerſal learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: However they have certain forms of caſes decided before, which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred and kept upon record; and from this, as from the advices they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from ſome Lawyers they carry along with them, they are enabled to give ſentences, and paſs judgments, which (as in other places) are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unjuſt, and very prejudical to the parties: The thing they mind moſt of all, is, to inſtruct themſelves of the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57548:72"/>Lawes and Cuſtomes of their Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, wherein they ſucceed well: But thoſe who are employed to be Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours in forrain Courts, and thoſe who are Lawyers and plead cauſes, ſtudy both Law and Learning, though the Art of relating Hiſtories well, and the <hi>belle lettere,</hi> or curious humane learning, be that which they affect moſt of all: As to the reſt, practiſe more then theorie, is their guide; but as this experience is of two ſorts, the one from the long ſtanding of the world, which doth afford general rules, and the other is that which men acquire in particular through the courſe of their life, which if it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great parts and learning, is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe and cloudy, that hardly it ever comes to that degree of excellency which is found in ſome actions, and the judiciouſneſs of ſome men: Hence it is, that this bare experience, and without method, proves very often prejudicial to particular men, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the Republick, becauſe it learns to undo more then to do, and never knows order, but by the ſight of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57548:73"/>diſorders: So it happens ſometimes to this Republick, for ſending often young unlearned, and unexperienced men to be Governours of Cities and places, who thereby commit many er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and diſorders, whereof the worſt falls upon the Subjects, who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by involved in many troubles and charges: However the Republick is very ſevere in puniſhing thoſe faults which theſe do commit of a ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, eſpecially if they ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be bribed to do ſome unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. Upon this account, a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who had been poſſeſſed in <hi>Crema,</hi> was beheaded ſome years ago, becauſe he had received, as it was proved, fifty pieces in Gold, with promiſe to favour the giver: And as the very report of a bad adminiſtration of Juſtice and Government is ſufficient, not onely to have the Nobles hereafter excluded from further preferments, but alſo to cauſe them to be puniſhed for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to make them forfeit their reputation, which alſo reflects ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what upon their families: So when they come to the diſcharge of their
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57548:73"/>employments they are very careful of doing juſtice, and of promoting the publick good: and what abuſes they commit, are acted with great dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: So that for all the particular failings I have mentioned, which are altogether unavoidable in humane things; that Republick for the right and juſt adminiſtration of her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt receive her due praiſes: and although in point of life and death, amongſt them, one friend be very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to ſolicite for another; yet as to civil matters, to ſpeak in a mans behalf it would do him more harme then good.</p>
               <p>It is true, as to their ſeats of Juſtice, that there is nothing ſo tedious and ſo chargeable as the ſuits that are before them, neither is there any place where are ſo many Courts of Juſtice as in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and in the Cities of her Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for the poor people who are at Law being forced to follow appeals to <hi>Venice</hi> are put to tedious and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary charges, and ſee no end of their cauſes, eſpecially if they are to deal with ſome of the Nobles, or other rich
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57548:74"/>perſons, for in all places where Appeals are admitted the richeſt will tire out the poor: So that this is one of the greateſt faults of that Republick, but it is committed upon a politick ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as we ſaid elſewhere, to keep people in exerciſes, and the Courts of Juſtice in credit. Now in <hi>Venice</hi> are all the Courts and Tribunals follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Court of the <hi>Procuratore,</hi> which judgeth of things relating to the <hi>Proctors:</hi> Before this Court are brought matters of Legacies, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ariſing between men of different profeſſion concerning the ſame, and Controverſies between Husbands and Wives.</p>
               <p>The Court <hi>della Petitione,</hi> of Requeſts, hears Cauſes of above an hundred <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> lire or pounds, (that is, four pound in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or thereabouts) concerning thoſe whom guilt made fly away; orders the pawning and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying of goods in the Cuſtom houſe; obliges men to ſtand to their bargains and agreements made by word of mouth, or in writing; doth Tax and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57548:74"/>Regulate charges upon the deſire of the Commiſſioners, or rather Executors, ſettles and confines expence of thoſe who are under age, decides differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences about Wills, and Confirmes, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Sentences from fifty Duckets downwards.</p>
               <p>The Office <hi>dell' Fuaraſtiero</hi> of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers, judgeth Caſes between <hi>Venetians</hi> and ſtrangers, and about houſe-hold ſtuffs, Boates hire, and of accidents depending thereupon, as when wares are caſt into the Sea out of Ships; it doth not relieve Cauſes about leſs then ten Duckets, but it proceeds ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily.</p>
               <p>The Tribunal <hi>dell' Mobile,</hi> of move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, judgeth of things of fifty Duckets and leſs, 'tis of its juriſdiction to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide controverſies about moveables diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by Wills and Teſtaments, and of other things which a dead man hath done in his life time, if it be his own hand-writing ſigned by two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tribunale dell' proprio</hi> judgeth of four things of concernment; the firſt is the matter of portions after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57548:75"/>and of joyntures; the ſecond about differnces ariſing between Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when they divide any State: the third is concerning ſucceſſions <hi>ab inteſtato,</hi> when a man hath made no Will: The fourth is matter of bounds and limits of buildings, that one doth not encroach upon anothers ground, and the like. Further, this Court judges of all Cauſes between nigh and ſtrict relations.</p>
               <p>The Court <hi>dell' Eſſaminatore,</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines witneſſes <hi>ad perpetuam rei me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriam,</hi> takes cognizance whether ſales were well or ill made, and intervenes to ſales made by the Commiſſary, doth ſign the inſtruments of Donation, and keeps a regiſter of all conditional Legacies.</p>
               <p>There are alſo <hi>li Cattaveri,</hi> who take care to recover thoſe goods which fall to the State from them who dye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any Will, and leave no Succeſſours; they revoke and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way penalties laid by other Judges, if they think it fit; they ſell <hi>all Incanto</hi> by the publick Cryers invitation, in the name of the State, thoſe Lands which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57548:75"/>belong to it, to thoſe who offer the moſt at port-ſale: They are judges of things found at Sea, and of treaſures diſcovered under ground: They hear differences between thoſe who go in pilgrimage to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of ſhips who carry them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Office is written the name of every Pilgrim bound for that place; they alſo decide matters of prices.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Piovego</hi> doth judge about con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts of Uſury; Of Cauſes about high wayes, and takes care that no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man doth build or otherwiſe treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs upon the Channels, or upon the Streets.</p>
               <p>The Office of the <hi>Sindici</hi> is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee unreaſonable and exceſſive charges, made in the acts of Juſtice, they take the place of ordinary Judges, when they are choſen by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sopragaſtaldi</hi> are ordinary Judges of the Execution of Sentences, they ſell goods by an intermitted Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and hear differences about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſions, Executions and Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Auditori Vecchi</hi> are to hear the Appeals of the City, Cauſes of the Courts of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> and of <hi>Rialto;</hi> they either do refer Cauſes, or elſe bring them into the <hi>Quarantia civil Vecchia:</hi> They judge whether the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Witneſſes ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or not; and generally the cauſes of <hi>Compromeſſi</hi> or references to Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traters are brought into this Office.</p>

After theſe Rectors are gone from their Government, the <hi>Auditori</hi> do receive Appeals one month after, within the State called <hi>Trevigian,</hi> and of other Cities and Caſtles two months after: But about Sea-affairs they receive it at

Phyſicians who are willing to practice muſt take a Licenſe in this Office; as Mountebanks, and others, who appear ſo upon Stages muſt alſo do ſo: Herein are entred the names of <hi>Cortagiane,</hi> or proſtitute wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, at preſent, as it is gueſſed, to the number of twenty five thouſand, or there abouts; beſides the number of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57548:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>thoſe who are private, and of married women, which muſt needs be vaſt in ſo populous a City. The cauſes of which I think to be in part the nature of the Climate, of the Dyet, the temper of the people, and in part that ſeverity and rigidneſs of parents and husband; to their daughters and wives, who are deprived of an honeſt liberty; ſo that that upon occaſion they paſs from one extream to another: and they think they may allow themſelves a licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, becauſe they are deprived of a lawful liberty. <hi>Nitimur in vetitum,</hi> is a true and a common ſaying: <hi>People long after, and are greedy of that which is forbidden,</hi> being perſwaded that ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len waters of pleaſures are ſweet, they watch opportunities to come by it. A horſe who hath liberty to go from the ſtable to the water, and thence to run up and down the grounds, is not ſo wild, nor ſo hard to be come by, as one which is conſtantly tyed in a ſtable, and under bridle and curb, if once he ſlips out of the Grooms hand. So it is of men and women who are kept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der too ſevere a guard: if once they
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57548:79"/>break looſe, they will not eaſily come in again. And comparing both their conditions, the bitterneſs of the former adds much to the ſweetneſs of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which the more they like, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they are willing to enjoy: doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether ever hereafter they ſhall have any ſuch opportunities, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more loath they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home, to be again under a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
               <p>Another cauſe of this miſcarriage of <hi>Venetian</hi> women (I cal all thoſel ſo who live in <hi>Venice,</hi> for otherwiſe there are many in it from other parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſeveral of <hi>Candia,</hi> and other <hi>Greek</hi> women) is the inticements of the place, eſpecially the ſuggeſtions and company of ſome ſubtle cunning perſons both of men &amp; women, who have by a conſtant practiſe attained to ſuch an Art of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating themſelves, that as ſoon as they have acceſs to a woman, with their peſtilentious breath they will blaſt any thing of honeſty or chaſtity that was in them. Such a one hath been that great <hi>Ruffiano,</hi> who dyed not long ſince, named <hi>Paola Gemma,</hi> who in
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57548:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>his life time had ſeduced almoſt as many women as he had hairs on his head; whoſe words were ſo powerfully deſtructive, that it is thought in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> the man never ſpoke twice to a woman, but ſhe yielded to his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; he uſed ſo much to preſs things upon them, upon the grounds of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, pleaſure, and other plauſible and ſpecious pretences and reaſons, and that in ſo eloquent and pathetick a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>way, acting ſometimes the part of a Confeſſour, of a Preacher, and of an Oratour, in his Threatnings, Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Perſwaſions, Commendations &amp; inticements, that 'tis to be wondered at the Senates (who knew well how dangerous a man this was) ſuffering of him, were it not that by report ſome of them made uſe of him.

               <p>Of theſe Offices, ſome conſiſt of 40 Senatours, others of 25, 20, others more or leſs, but none is of leſs then three; and although all theſe Courts appear to be much regulated, as indeed they are in themſelves, yet, many of them are ſuperfluous, and introduced onely to keep in exerciſe and from idleneſs the great number of the Nobility, to bring them up in the management of affairs, and that thereby ſome may get a ſubſiſtance and a livelihood; and as
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57548:84"/>the beſt things are apt to be corrupt, ſo corruption hath crept into ſeveral of theſe Courts: which very often men are admitted into, by ſtrength of monies. And although this long enumeration of Seats of Juſtice may ſeem tedious to ſome; yet thus much I thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to mention: for they are all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways, which one time or other he who lives there, ſhall have occaſion to make uſe of; all which publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are much concerned to know how to carry on more ſucceſsfully the intereſts of their Princes with that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</p>
               <p>Now for variety ſake, I muſt paſs to things of another nature; and here the manner of Electing a <hi>Doge,</hi> and ſome things precedaneous to that action, muſt not be omitted. As ſoon as one Duke is Dead, the ſix <hi>Conſiglieri,</hi> and the three <hi>Capi di</hi> 40, who compoſe the Council of Ten, do ſhut up themſelves within the Palace of St. <hi>Mark:</hi> whence they do not go out till after the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a new one; and the Eldeſt of the <hi>Conſiglieri</hi> acts the part of <hi>Vice-Duke.</hi> The Corps is ſoon buried in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57548:84"/>the night time by the care of ſome of his Relations: but withall his Effigy in Wax cloathed with the Ducal Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is carried into a room, called, <hi>Sala de proveghi,</hi> there to lye in State for the ſpace of three dayes, twenty of the Nobles being appointed to ſit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it in their Scarlet Robes: and then without any expreſſion of publick grief, mourning or ſorrow, his Fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals are performed in a great Pomp and Solemnity in the Church of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> the next day after, the <hi>Gran Conſiglio</hi> meets, the Great Chancellour puts them in mind, that feeing a new Duke is to be choſen, they owe according to cuſtom to name the [three <hi>Inquiſitori,</hi> and the five <hi>Correttori,</hi> after which the Vice-Duke ſayes ſomething in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the deceaſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts every one to mind the good and honour of the Republick in the future Election, and nothing elſe: Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are choſen the <hi>Inquiſitori</hi> and <hi>Correttori;</hi> in ſhort, the task of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is to examine the life and actions of the late Duke, to ſee whether he hath obſerved the Lawes; and if they
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57548:85"/>find he hath failed in any thing, they are bound to accuſe him before the Gran Council, for the which his heirs are fined, or otherwiſe puniſhed, juſt as if they were his own perſon; So the heirs of the laſt Duke, of the Family <hi>Loredano,</hi> were fined to 1500 <hi>Vecchini,</hi> becauſe it was found he had not lived according to the Majeſty of his degree and quality; and this is a way to keep Dukes in awe, for fear their ſucceſſours ſhould bear the puniſhment of their faults. Now the Office of the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rettori,</hi> is to ſee what things are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len amiſs, in the adminiſtration of the late Duke, that accordingly as they find and acquaint the Great Council with it, by the plurality of Votes, things may be annull'd, added to, or altered, as they ſee occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>Within a fortnight after the <hi>Doge</hi>'s death, all the Noble <hi>Venetians</hi> that are full thirty years Old, do meet in the great Council Hall; and as many Balls as there are men, are caſt into a box: of which Balls, thirty are of Gold, or gilt, and the reſt of Silver; every Noble draws one Ball, and they who have
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57548:85"/>the thirty of Gold, retire into a room to caſt the lot of thirty <hi>Pallotte,</hi> as they call it, or Balls, for they put in thirty, nine of which are of Gold, and they who draw theſe, do remain in the room; but others do go into the great Council Hall; in the mean while, of the nine who remained, the four who had the firſt four balls, do name five men apiece, whom they pleaſe; and the five who had the five laſt balls, do every one name four others; which number makes forty in all, and every one may name himſelf for one; and theſe are called the Electors of the firſt Election, who are confirmed by the <hi>Gran Conſiglio,</hi> after which they break up. But the next day the forty men do put in forty balls, of which twelve are of Gold, and the reſt of Silver; of theſe remain onely the twelve, who have drawn the golden balls, who are called the Electors of the ſecond Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Every one of theſe doth name two more, but he who drew the firſt golden ball, names three, in all twenty five; then theſe twenty five put in balls again, of which nine are of gold, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57548:86"/>they who draw them, are called the Electors of the third Election. Again, every one of theſe nine, names what four he pleaſes, but he who drew the laſt golden ball, names only three, this makes up thirty five, who put in as many balls, whereof eleven are of gold, and they only who draw them do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main: theſe eleven name every one four, in all forty four; after which are again thrown in forty one balls of gold, and three of ſilver, the three with the ſilver ones are excluded, but the others remain, who are confirmed by the Gran Council, and theſe do Elect the Duke.</p>
               <p>In order thereunto, they lock up themſelves within the Council Hall, though the whole Palace be at that time under lock and key; and three of the moſt venerable of the company they chuſe to be <hi>Priori</hi> of the Election, and two others to be Secretaries; the other thirty ſix divide themſelves into four parties, every one going into what party he pleaſeth; after this the three <hi>Priori</hi> do ſit upon three chairs higher then the reſt, and the two Secretaries
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57548:86"/>over againſt, with a Table before them; then the Secretaries call the thirty ſix one after another, who put every one in a Box prepared for that effect, the name of him whom he deſires ſhould be Duke, and uſually all thoſe of one party do put in but for one; So that thereby four only are in nomination; after this the Secretaries open the Box, and read the names of thoſe who are put in: who if they be in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are deſired one after another to withdraw into another room; after which the <hi>Priori</hi> or Preſidents aske every one of the Electors, whether they have any thing to object againſt thoſe who are in nomination, why any one ſhould not be choſen; and if any thing be brought againſt him, he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in to clear himſelf: which if he cannot do, he is excluded, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther named in his place. Then are laid two boxes before the Secretaries, the one for the affirmative, &amp; the other for the negative; within theſe every one is to put alittle ball, and if in the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive there be more then in the other, it will remain; and this is done for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57548:87"/>one of the four, of whom he who hath moſt balls doth remain: but the Votes for the affirmative muſt not be leſs then twenty five; and they will not give over voting till it be come to that number, or paſt it: This being done, if he who is choſen be without, he is ſent for; if within, they make him ſit, and the forty or forty one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be Duke, and waite upon him to his houſe: where he ſtayes for two dayes, till his Ducal habit be made; then in the morning he goes to hear Maſs at the Church of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> attended by all his Electors, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain Miniſters; then he goes into a <hi>Pozzo,</hi> as they call it, a kind of ſeat or chair with one of his nigheſt rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Chancellour, and ſo is carried by twenty four Maſters of the <hi>Arſenal</hi> about the Palace of St. <hi>Mark;</hi> at the ſame time the <hi>Doge</hi> and his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, throwing monies amongſt the people, till they come to the gate of the Ducal Palace, where he is expected by thoſe who elected him, and the chief of the <hi>Priori</hi> layes the Ducal Cap, which is a kind of Crown; upon his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57548:87"/>head, giving him the title of <hi>Sereniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo,</hi> and ſo wait on him to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary lodging of the <hi>Doges,</hi> where he begins to receive publick viſits of the Magiſtrates, and forrain Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>He is allowed by the Republick five hundred <hi>Zecchini,</hi> or about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty pound by the month, for they are not very willing to beſtow both honour and riches upon one; it is true, he hath alſo the diſpoſal of ſome Eccleſiaſtical Offices, and of other places, which he may ſell if they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be vacant in his time; once a week, that is every wedneſday, he uſes to go down into the Courts of Juſtice when Judges do ſit, exhorting every one of them to do good ſpeed and juſtice; and if any one hath applyed himſelf to him, he Commends the cauſe to the Judges, as the caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
               <p>The Ceremony I mentioned, of the Dukes inſtauration, is the more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, becauſe it befalls him but once in his life. But there is another which once a year he performs, when
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57548:88"/>he Eſpouſes the Sea upon Aſcenſion day, which to ſee as well as the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naval,</hi> is worth the curioſity of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; for as one allows a great liberty of <hi>Maſcarads,</hi> and variety of ſports; ſo the other affords as curious a ſhew as can be ſeen. The Duke attended by Ambaſſadours, and by the Chief Nobles in a rich and ſtately Ship or Barge, (though indeed it is neither, but of a ſingular making) named <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centoro,</hi> attended by ſeveral thouſands of <hi>Gondola</hi>'s, goes three or four miles out to Sea, amongſt the ſhooting of the Guns in the ſhips, which are thereabouts, and the ſounding of Trumpets; he caſts a Ring into the Sea, and pronounces theſe <hi>Italian</hi> words; <hi>Io ti ſpoſo in Segno di Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> I Eſpouſe thee in token of my Dominion over thee; this he doth in the name of the Republick, which (by a grant of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, thereby expreſſing his Obligation to her for her aſſiſtance againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa,</hi> with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of all <hi>Italian</hi> Princes and States, and of ſeveral parts of <hi>Europe,</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:57548:88"/>and by a long ſucceſſive poſſeſſion) hath the Royalty of the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, or gulf of <hi>Venice,</hi> which hitherto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick hath ſtoutly ſecured from <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Pyrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having mentioned the <hi>Carnaval,</hi> I muſt explain what it is: At a certain time of the year, immediately before Lent, about Shrove-Tueſday, but ſome dayes ſooner, according to the new Stile, <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks do obſerve a cuſtome which they received from Heathens, which is, to paſs that time with all the mirth and ſports they can conceive, glutting themſelves with pleaſures before they enter into Lent, which they account to be a time of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to them; <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf is as buſie at it as the reſt, a great ſtreet of it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the <hi>Corſo,</hi> being the ordinary place for Races of Jewes, Horſes, Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, &amp;c. for ſhews of ſome new Coaches, Charrets, people diſguiſed, and in vizzards, who throw up to the windows (which are full of women) eggs full of perfumed Waters, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meates, Sugar-plums, &amp;c. The moſt grave Cardinals and Prelates, give
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57548:89"/>themſelves a full Carrier, ſome as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, others as actors, it being a thing well known, how one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals was by the late Pope command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe in a womans cloathes, he had been riding on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back in this <hi>Corſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this, <hi>Venice</hi> goes beyond all other places, if one conſiders the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, variety and quality of their ſports, amongſt which are their famous <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peras,</hi> ſo much talk'd of abroad; 'tis indeed a great delight to ſee their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical pieces acted upon their Stages, with ſuch a variety of Scenes, number of <hi>Machines,</hi> and excellent muſick, of Voices and inſtruments; which Vocal muſick, though it ſeems not to pleaſe thoſe who are not uſed to it, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of certain <hi>Fredonies</hi> or quakings, yet it is the moſt learned of any muſick in other places: Nor only they employ their good <hi>Cantarine,</hi> as they call them, that is, women in <hi>Venice</hi> who have good Voices, and make profeſſion of ſinging, but alſo when they hear of any extraordinary ones abroad, they are ſent for (as hath been that rare
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57548:89"/>ſinging woman of <hi>Bologna</hi>) and are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally rewarded for their pains. In point of Playes, that which is the moſt Comical, is that whereat <hi>Venetians</hi> are pleaſed beſt of all, and indeed their Bouffoons go beyond any in the world; and if the young Nobles who ſtand by be not pleaſed at what is acted, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time out of frolick, they hiſs, whiſtle, throw Apples and other things upon the Actors, and do ſuch like things, which if it were not in <hi>Carnaval</hi> time, were much unbecoming the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gravity. One day as one of the Actors fell upon a learned Diſcourſe about Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Phyloſophy, one of the grave <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian</hi> Nobleman had hardly patience to let him go ſo far as he did, but at laſt he could forbear no longer, but took his <hi>Bezetta</hi> or Cap, and threw it at him, ſaying, <hi>You Fool, I am come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be made to laugh, and not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed; and therefore change Diſcourſe, and make me laugh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At that time there is alſo great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing after their way, that is, leading one unknown to you, (neither can you tell whether it be a man or a woman)
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57548:90"/>but no ſpeaking at all, and they are all diſguiſed, and in viſards, at the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Violins, they dance from one chamber to another. And as the people of <hi>Venice</hi> are great Gameſters, ſo ſpecially about this time in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, they Dice and Card away many thouſands of pounds: Women alſo who at other times are kept ſo cloſe, have liberty allowed them to run up and down <hi>Incognito,</hi> which doth fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour many a meeting, and a rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz, which at other times they would tremble to think of; as indeed it would cauſe poyſonings, ſtabbings and murthers; but then a man happens ſometimes to Game and Dance with his Wife, and yet not know her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they never ſpeak a word: Indeed it is a wonder to ſee what a <hi>topſy turvy</hi> there is at that time in that City, ſo much they have given up themſelves for the time to their pleaſures; and therefore 'twas not without reaſon that one of the <hi>Gran Turk's</hi> Servant whom he had ſent thither about that time, told him at his return, <hi>That the Venetians were very Grave and Wiſe,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57548:90"/>but once a year they were uſed to run all ſtark mad; and again upon a ſudden</hi> (on Aſh wedneſday) <hi>they came to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their diſtractedneſs;</hi> yet ſome are ſo fooliſh (but this is ſpecially in <hi>Rome</hi>) under pretence of doing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their extravagancies, as to beat and whip themſelves under their Miſtreſſes windows, and up and down the ſtreets, and fetch blood out of their backs and ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>Now after this Diſcourſe, it will not be amiſs to paſs from the pleaſant, to that which is ſerious, and ſpeak very few words of a politick practice of the Republick, which at firſt was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by neceſſity, but by experience hath been found beneficial to them, 'tis the uſe they make of ſtrangers, not only to be their great and inferiour Land Officers, but alſo their common Souldiers, as <hi>Germans, French, Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> Subjects of other Princes; by the firſt, they free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from dangers, which valiant and ambitious men make their Country run, who having an intereſt at home, and the love of an Army in the field,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57548:91"/>may be enticed to attempt againſt the liberty of their Country, which a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger muſt not pretend to; beſides that, when wars are ended, they are diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the State eaſed of his charges: And by the laſt they ſpare the life of their Subjects, with the price of that of ſtrangers, who do fight, offend and defend as they are put upon it; and whilſt their own Subjects have been ſafe, and grown numerous at home, they have made Conqueſts with the loſs of Forrainers blood: By a practice contrary to this, and by ſending too far and too many of their people out of the Land, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have unpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled their Country, and made it void of inhabitants.</p>
               <p>But from this general and publick practice of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> I will paſs to a more particular and private one, introduced alſo for the ſafety of the State; for hereby diſcoveries are made, not only of horrid and ſecret crimes, by what rank ſoever of perſons commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but chiefly of Plots and Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies againſt the State, or the Lawes, which to reveale in thoſe parts is very
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57548:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>dangerous; and if the Accuſer was known, the accuſed could take one courſe or other quickly to make him away; therefore in a publick place of the Palace of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> there is for the Office of the Inquiſitors a little hole in the wall, through the which one can put in any Bill of Accuſation, without naming the accuſer, yet with circumſtances, and ſome neceſſary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, whereby further informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be had. This place is under ſeveral Keys, without which it cannot be opened, ſo that in caſe one of the Keepers were concerned, it could not be concealed from the knowledge of others. But this way is ſubject to many great inconveniencies, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one would not approve, were it not for any other conſideration but this, that hardly any one is ſafe thereby from troubles and accuſations; yet that jealouſie of State of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of that Republick is ſo great, that as they think to prevent dangers, they are carried to an extraordinary ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and do unjuſt things; As the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Noble <hi>Foſcarini</hi> can wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57548:92"/>he was accuſed by two wicked fellows, to have had correſpondency with a forrain Embaſſadour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was hanged; and yet a little while after one of the Rogues being condemned to dye for ſome villanies he had done, Confeſſed that <hi>Foſcarini</hi> was innocent, and that what he had done againſt him was out of ſpleen and malice; whereupon what remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Corps was by order taken down, honourably buried, and ſome ſatisfaction given the Family by the State; but alas this could never bring the man to life again.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall come to the nature and cuſtomes of <hi>Venetians,</hi> whence it will appear how Subjects there ſtand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to their Superiours; becauſe from the beginning of this diſcourſe I determined to ſpeak of every moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and eſſential thing concerning that Republick; but I will do it brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: And as the good or bad nature, manners and cuſtomes of a Nation, are that which make it flouriſh, or cauſe its ruine; ſo hence one may be able to ground his judgment about this, how
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57548:92"/>long or how little that Republick is like to laſt.</p>
               <p>The Republick of <hi>Venice</hi> is an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly conſiſting of a great number of Noblemen, ſo much differing in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, judgement and affection, that it may be compared to a Sea blown upon by all manner of winds: Private ends and intereſts are ſtrong amongſt them, of late years more then they were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, according to that decay which every thing on Earth is expoſed unto; and after the height which through her vertue this Republick hath attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto, it is not to be admired, if in theſe laſt years ſhe is fallen into ſome declination, through that general cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which is in the World. Theſe Nobles are greedy to increaſe their Riches, which ſometimes makes them ſhrink from that which is honeſt and juſt; they are very deſirous of glory, and of getting a name, which is indeed a commendable thing (as long as men aim at it by good and lawfull means) were it not that this works jealouſies, envies and emulations of one againſt another: They love to be feared, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57548:93"/>look for an extraordinary reſpect; Hence 'tis that they diſlike ſo much chidings, cenſures, ſmart Counſels, and that they will not confeſs the faults which they have committed; they are apt to ſuſpect others of having deſigns to diminiſh their greatneſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ballance one another, that they ſhould not grow ſo potent as to give a juſt ground of fear to their Neighbours, whoſe Glory they both obſerve and envie, except they be of the ſame party, which are things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable in Republicks; they take much notice of thoſe who put delayes to the obtaining of their deſires, or who exclude them from their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, till they have occaſion of being avenged.</p>
               <p>Further, the love of the Noble <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian,</hi> and the confidence which he ſeems to have in others, or which he wiſhes others to have in him, are not real nor ſincere, but fained, except there be a golden chain to make it faſt: the truth is, they are much ſelf-ended, and their friendſhip laſts no longer then doth their intereſt; they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57548:93"/>diſſemblers, and therefore make great ſhewes, and would give ſigns of great affection one towards another, as indeed the State's practiſe is in a high degree, with all thoſe Princes who are able to do them a kindneſs, or a diſcourteſie one time or other, for indeed they look not only to the preſent, but alſo to that which is to come.</p>
               <p>The meetings which upon every holy day they have in a place about St. <hi>Mark,</hi> called <hi>Broglio,</hi> do not breed that love and affection which they talk of, but rather a high and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſſembling; whence ariſes the uſe of low Congees, and humble Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and thoſe ſweet and courteous words they ſpeak one to another, which are given under the pretence of the dignity of them who receive it, and in hopes that others will return it to them in the ſame degree; ſo they think thereby to become the more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable to the people, to whom this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as a preſident of that reſpect they are to give to the Nobility: And the truth is, they love exceſs in every
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57548:94"/>thing that pleaſes them, but hate to hear others commending any thing they have; they love gifts and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which do bring honour or profit to them, whereby afterwards are obtained thoſe graces and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes which they deſire.</p>
               <p>Their peace and preſervation by any means they endeavour to get, out of this wrong principle, that <hi>the evil which accidentally produces good may be committed,</hi> according to the practiſe of thoſe States-men who walk meerly upon politick grounds. They are very exact in the choice they make of their Ambaſſadours, for they chuſe ſubtle, ſagacious, and dexterous perſons, who know the way how to inſinuate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their affairs into the eſteem and affection of thoſe whom they treat withall; accute and eloquent in their Diſcourſes, of a ſweet converſation; wiſe to take advantages, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove opportunities; prudent to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come difficulties, and not to provoke when they refuſe thoſe things which they have no mind, or which 'tis not their intereſt to grant, and indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57548:94"/>in their endeavours to obtain their ends, and in their writing to their Maſters every particular thing worthy of their knowledge: They ſearch, and uſually find out the love, hatred, the favours, diſgraces, intereſts, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, and contrary parties, the ſtrength, inclinations, favourites, and the deſigns of Princes, and who upon the leaſt overtures do find out, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and dive into things of any great concernment, and they ſpare nothing to get information of every thing. This in politicks is the nature of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Venice,</hi> wherein if they do amiſs, they are not alone; the ſame being found in other Countries, for States are governed by Policy, more then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Conſcience or Religion, (though ſeldome without ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to this laſt) and ſelf ends, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, Covetouſneſſe and Ambition grow in others Gardens as well as in <hi>Venice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in ordinary things, and of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind, the nature of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Noblemen, ſpecially of thoſe who are young, is very odious, by reaſon of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57548:95"/>their pride, and of their inſolencies; it cauſes them to commit ſtrange things, as almoſt every Subject and every place can teſtifie, as well as the curſes pronounced againſt them: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their Government be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and the general adminiſtration be ſo much eſteemed as indeed it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it, yet their moral and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar actions are very irregular: And as Lawes are ſevere in puniſhing faults committed againſt the State, ſo they are remiſs (at leaſt in their Execution) againſt particular failings and miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages; hence are cauſed inſults, da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and violences, which ſome ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Nobles in their Goods, States, Honour and Life, ſpecially thoſe who are poor, and who have no friends nor favour, nor means enough to reſiſt them. So the Eſtates of the Widow and the Fatherleſs are expoſed to their Covetouſneſs; the honour of Maids and Women to their Luxury, and the perſons and lives of men to their hatred and revenge: And theſe evil courſes they are ſtrengthned in, by reaſon of their Birth, Riches, Power,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57548:95"/>Authority, Relations and Friends; for as they are almoſt all ſubject to theſe actions, they avour one another, not knowing how ſoon it may happen to be the turn of every one of them; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account they go unpuniſhed, ſo that of a hundred hardly the third part is accuſed; and of theſe the proofs are clear hardly againſt the half, and thoſe who are convinced are but ſlightly puniſhed; ſo that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding encourages them to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, peremptory, and unjuſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>Yet the fault of this is not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Magiſtrates, for in things of concernment they are very exact in doing juſtice, when they who are wronged apply themſelves to them for redreſs. But the queſtion is, how they may bring in their complaints to them, which is very difficult, not only becauſe clear proofs are not eaſily brought in againſt them, ſome of their exceſſes being committed either in the dark and ſecretly, or very dexterouſly, but chiefly, becauſe as ſoon as a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath miſdemeaned himſelf, he
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57548:96"/>ſtops proceedings againſt him, either with threatnings or flatteries, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and if need be, with money, which indeed is the laſt remedy they uſe: but for the moſt part they lay the fault upon the <hi>Bravi,</hi> that is in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the <hi>Hectors,</hi> who being men of no fortune, do for a ſubſiſtance accompany them, and act according to their orders; or elſe upon ſome of their Servants whom they ſend out of the way; or they induce ſome to be falſe witneſſes for them, whereby they put a cheat upon the Lawes and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; whence we ſee, that in <hi>Venice</hi> they have alſo as in other places, a new Logick, and a way of drawing ſtrange conſequences, as this, He is a gallant man, for he hath three or four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound a year, becauſe by the ſtrength of his monies he can come off with any bad and baſe actions; like great flyes, who having ſtrong wings fly through cob-webs, when poor weak ones are caught: So that if ſometimes it falls out that a Nobleman be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Exile or Priſon, in a ſhort time he is releaſed by the means of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57548:96"/>friends and monies. This ſhews how the beſt things are apt to be corrupted, and that this Republick ſo famous and ſo excellent doth degenerate in her members, which in time may infect the head and the whole body, for bad humours of this kind are apt to break out at one time or other, eſpecially in this place, where the old as the young Noblemen are divided into factions and parties, and have inteſtine hatred one for another, and againſt the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens; with the former by reaſon of envyings in point of honour and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, with the latter upon the account of Riches, and this ever cauſes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in a Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that on the other ſide Subjects of all degrees and qualities are diſſatisfied for things named before, and particularly ſeeing themſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their goods upon ſlight grounds, and that they cannot enjoy charges and offices, wherein they think themſelves uſed not as patriots, but like ſtrangers. Merchants alſo and Tradeſmen have ſome grounds of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, becauſe the Nobles having of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57548:97"/>late turned their Trade which was by Sea, into that which is by Land, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Authority or by ſtrength of monies, have ingroſſed it to themſelves, whether it be Corn, Wine, Silks, Iron, Wool, Timber, Coals, and any other conſiderable commodities, which is the cauſe of complaints and miſeries pitty-worthy; for the Nobles being monied men they get things over the head of their inferiours.</p>
               <p>But the worſt is, that theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes are committed in a cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and they in great numbers are ſent into all parts of the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where they extort from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects monies to ſatisfie their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ambition, and act many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt things, which are effects of their tyranny, but are the cauſe of the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and injuries of Subjects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by juſtice is perverted, charity deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, honeſty ſuppreſſed, the fear of God removed from before their eyes, and the people defrauded of the protection they have a right to expect; whence ſad conſequences may be drawn againſt thoſe States where crimes go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57548:97"/>for 'tis not enough to ſee good actions rewarded, if bad ones be not diſcountenanced; though as I have already expreſſed, the Magiſtrate is not to be blamed for theſe miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, yet in time theſe things cauſe ruine and deſtruction to States. A great proſperity is the greateſt enemy of men, for it makes them inſolent, licentious, bold to do evil, and even apt to diſturb their own reſt, and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and 'tis certain that uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, abuſes, and other injuries take ſo deep roots in the breaſts of Subjects, that upon a favourable occaſion they will reſent it.</p>
               <p>Theſe corruptions as they are preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the States wherein they are ſpread, ſo they prove oftentimes bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to forraign Publick Miniſters, who know how to uſe the Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome uſeful perſons and their Maſters monies, according to the fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity they ought to have for his intereſts; and 'tis a thing which <hi>Venetians</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> moſt of all other Nations, to leave it to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of their Miniſters in forrain
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57548:98"/>places to diſtribute that way what ſums they think fit, for which they take their word, and ask no further account of it, knowing that to ſtint and confine, would not onely diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, but alſo prove prejudicial to their affairs, no monies being better employed, then thoſe which are laid out upon ſuch occaſions; and though they ſhould amount high, yet a good advice, or another good affair pays for all: And in this caſe no manner of friendſhip is to be ſlighted or rejected, though it were never ſo low and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, becauſe it may be profitable upon ſome accounts, and it may ſerve at one time or another.</p>
               <p>Now as to matter of Trade, which juſt now I was ſpeaking of, although it be commonly known to be beneficial to Nations, yet becauſe every one is not well acquainted with the reaſon and cauſes of it, 'twill not be amiſs to ſay ſomething about it, not as to the particulars of it, for it would take up too much time, there being ſo many and ſeveral wayes, according to the nature of places and Countries; and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57548:98"/>thoſe who underſtand well the manner of it are to be eſteemed in a State, and their advice is to be taken about the way of ſettling and improving it, by Princes and their Miniſters; the truth of which is ſo well known, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, that in all Countryes there are Councels and Committees ſettled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, who are willing to hear any thing that may be propoſed tending to the advantage of it; and they who make a conſtant practice and profeſſion of it, muſt needs by their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be able to give light and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about it; and herein their opinion is to be taken as ſoon, if not ſooner, then that of the greateſt Stateſmen, if reaſon be joyned to their experience. The truth is, I look upon this as the ground and bottome of Policy; for let the occaſions of the State as to charges be what they will, when there are ſure and conſtant yearly incomes 'tis ever ſupplyed, and ſo is able not only to ſettle peace at home, but alſo preſerve it ſelf from forraign at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and even upon occaſion to look abroad.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:57548:99"/>
               <p>Trade therefore is not to be negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, neither is it to be accounted a ſhame for a Gentleman to follow it, as it is in a potent Kingdome of <hi>Europe,</hi> which indeed is nothing but a pollicy of the Prince, even to be ſure of men to follow him in the warrs; for they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing to do are glad of any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to beſtir themſelves, which they would be loth to do if they were got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to a ſettledneſs of life; yet poverty and want of imployment makes many a one drop to the Gallows before there be occaſion for them in the War. Now the advantages which come by Trade are theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It makes ſome places famous and flouriſh, which otherwiſe would be poor and of no eſteem, which are ſo far from having any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves to procure them plenty and riches, that they want bread and neceſſaries wherewith to ſubſiſt, if it be not brought them from without: Of this ſort is <hi>Venice,</hi> the riches of whoſe Nobility have been much increaſed, if not wholly gotten by Trade, eaſily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on there with the help of the Sea, and of ſome navigable Rivers. And
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57548:99"/>what is it elſe but Trade which hath made <hi>Amſterdam</hi> ſo rich and ſo famous? And I dare ſay, according as it flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth or decayeth, it makes places fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, or of no note. By this means <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorn,</hi> formerly a dark hole, is become ſo univerſally known, <hi>Savena</hi> is almoſt forgotten, and <hi>Genoa,</hi> which hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the Trade of this laſt, is ſo much talkt of. What is become of <hi>Antwerp</hi> ſince the Trade of it hath been carried to <hi>Amſterdam?</hi> And how many more inſtances could <hi>I</hi> give of this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Trade keeps people in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, thoſe who follow it minding their buſineſſes; otherwiſe if they lye in idleneſs, 'tis of them as of ſtill waters, which uſually breed corruption, and like thoſe bodies, in which for want of exerciſe, bad and malignant humours do abound: ſo lazy and idle people are a dangerous burden to the States wherein they live.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Trade keeping men in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, frees them alſo from wants and ſtraits, which often drive men to great extreamities; hereby many are kept at work, and get a livelyhood, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57548:100"/>ſo are thereby engaged in the defence of the State, under whoſe protection they enjoy it; and being thus content and quiet, they are ſubmiſſive and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Authority.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, They who underſtand the way of Trade about Manufactures or otherwiſe, if they be frugal they thrive and grow rich, whereby they are able upon occaſion to aſſiſt the States, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their neighbours, and pay Taxes and other Duties.</p>
               <p>And Fifthly, The better Trade is, the greater ſtore of moneyes it brings into the publick Treaſure, by the way of Taxes, Exciſe, Farms and Cuſtomes raiſed upon imported or exported Commodities, when people ſend or carry their VVares to the good Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, or when they bring things from thence; all which is for the publick good, and for the particular advantage of Princes: beſides that, theſe Reaſons I have brought why Trade ſhould be promoted, are all grounded upon poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick grounds; and ſeveral others I could name, which I omit for brevity ſake. The truth is, that all Nations
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57548:100"/>are ſo generally and ſo fully convinced of it, that they now apply themſelves to it, as <hi>England</hi> of old, and <hi>Holland</hi> ſince the States were formed, and of late the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Swede,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>I omit to ſpeak of that luſt of the fleſh which Reigns every where in <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> where 'tis fulfilled by young and old of all Sexes in the way of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adultery, inceſt, ſodomy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo that though they be great Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, they are bad Chriſtians and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral livers. Not long ſince, within theſe five or ſix years there burſt out a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in <hi>Venice</hi> which made a great noiſe. A widow (of a competent eſtate, according to her quality, but inferiour to her heart) named <hi>Signora Cecilia,</hi> reſolved to beſtow her means, and the reſt of her life (as ſhe ſaid) upon pious uſes; to this effect, with the private encouragement ſhe received from ſome of the Nobles, and being publickly countenanced by two of the moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited amongſt them; one of which was of the Family <hi>Sagredo;</hi> ſhe got a great houſe, and upon the account of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57548:101"/>charity, ſhe received in't many poor young Maids, whom ſhe afforded neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary proviſions unto, and on the other ſide ſhe made them work for it: And when once ſhe had them in, ſhe would ſuffer none of the Relations, not ſo much as the Mother, to ſpeak with them; and as many poor people who had three or four Daughters were very glad to diſpoſe of one of them, ſo in a little time ſhe got a number of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four or five hundred within her walls; according to their ages they were kept in different places; and as they ſay, a great ſeverity was obſerved with the generality of them, inſomuch that the Mothers and ſome of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations began to clamour, that ſhe cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly tormented their Children (though they could hardly know what was done within her houſe:) Some ſaid ſhe kept them in fetters, others, that ſhe whipped them often for no offence; and as there is no end, when once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ignorant people have given way to their fancies, ſo others ſaid ſhe roſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of them to ſatisfie her cruelty; and although ſhe heard of theſe things,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57548:101"/>ſhe ſeemed not to be moved at it, and ſo held out ſeveral years; but at laſt the State could not avoid taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it upon many pregnant informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that under pretence of retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Nunnery, this was a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary of laciviouſneſs, and that ſome of the Chief Nobles had been ſeen to go in at undue hours, and againſt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſeemingly ſetled in her houſe, not to admit men into it: The buſineſs came to a great debate; and although ſhe had potent friends, yet the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity carried it againſt her; though it was thus mitigated, <hi>onely to avoid ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition,</hi> yet ſhe was found guilty of too much ſeverity, and of profaneneſs, for ſhe had inſerted this into the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, <hi>Sancta Cecilia ora pro nobis:</hi> ſo that after twelve years ſtanding her School was thus broken up.</p>
               <p>And this ſtory calls to my mind one of another nature, which at the ſame time was acted at <hi>Rome</hi> by a perſon of the ſame Sex, though for contrary ends; the former being for propagation, and this laſt for deſtruction. In the laſt Plague in <hi>Rome,</hi> an Ancient Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57548:102"/>called <hi>Madonna Giulia,</hi> took that opportunity to uſe her Art, which (as ſhe confeſſed ſince) helped ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds into the other world, under the notion of the Plague. Her pretended profeſſion was to dreſs Womens heads, but her real practice was to play the <hi>Ruffiana,</hi> as they call it; and as by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny married women ſhe was ſent for to comb their hair, and the like, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were entered into diſcourſe, ſhe felt which way their pulſe did beat, all tending to this, that one had a cruel Father, the other a jealous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and a third, a troubleſome Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but ſhe undertook to rid them of them all; and ſhe was as good as her word, for by the means of certain clear water which was given them to drink, they were ſoon diſpatched, and no ſign of poyſon appeared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: But God did thus pleaſe to put an end to her wicked life; there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be ſome ſuſpition of her, becauſe almoſt every one of thoſe whom ſhe frequented had loſt one Relation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and one of theſe let fall ſome words, expreſſing repentance of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57548:102"/>a wicked Act ſhe had done, which ſhe charged upon this <hi>Giulia;</hi> which words did not fall to the ground, but being reported to ſome Magiſtrate, hereby was laid the ground of the jealouſie, which afterwards they had of her; and therefore to find her out, they contrived thus: A Woman well inſtructed of what ſhe had to do, ſent for her one day to dreſs her head, and as ſhe was about it, the other began to ſigh from time to time, which ſhe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of, asked what all'd her, ſhe anſwered with ſighs, and ſaid, ſhe was an unfortunate married woman; ſhe went about to comfort her, but the firſt and ſecond viſit they went no further; but the following, this woman to her ſighs adding tears (which ſhe had at command) and complaining of her unhappineſs, and many times cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling her ſelf an unfortunate woman, the other gave her ſome comfortable words, and hopes of remedy; So that (not to inſiſt longer upon this) the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having ſhew'd a purſe with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in it, ſhe ſaid ſolemnly ſhe would give it to any one who would rid her
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57548:103"/>of her Husband; ſhe promiſed to bring her the water on the next day, which ſhe did in a little bottle: but againſt the time of her coming ſome Officers had hid themſelves behind a hanging, and having heard all the diſcourſes that paſſed between them, as ſhe was ſtretching the hand to give her the bottle, theſe men laid hold on her, and by good chance ſhe did not let the bottle fall, as ſhe might have done, which may be had ſaved her life; but having it, they tryed it upon a Dog, and other Creatures, which died of it; whereupon ſhe was condemned, and told the ingredients of it; diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the remedy to hinder its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which was publiſhed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent further miſchiefs, in caſe there were more of that water abroad; and this was onely to drink a little Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar: but ſhe was carried to <hi>Campo di fiori,</hi> the place of Execution for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, as they call them, Witches, and great and notorious Malefactors, and there ſhe was executed.</p>
               <p>But now I muſt come to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular way of an efficacious negotiating
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57548:103"/>with the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> which 'tis not only difficult, but almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to expreſs; for though the Lawes and Offices be ſtill the ſame, yet a change of perſons will work a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of alteration in the method; So that publick Miniſters ought to Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of buſineſſes, and the conjuncture of affairs, and to take ſuch reſolutions as their wiſdome ſhall ſuggeſt, for this depends chiefly upon the prudence of the Miniſter, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received before from his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour an exact relation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State, and a Character of the Prince, and of all his Miniſters, how they ſtand affected, and which way they may be wrought upon, as alſo of the adherents to his Maſters intereſt, will be enabled thereby to negotiate with more ſucceſs; which to attain unto at <hi>Venice,</hi> a great watchfulneſs is required to lay hold upon the occaſions, which ſlightings, hatred and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the Nobility do afford, wherein a great activity and quickneſs is to be uſed; and this for certain will prove very ſatisfactory and advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:57548:104" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>For indeed, when once the Nobles are bent one againſt another, their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion drives them to utmoſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all things they ſacrifice to their deſire of revenge. And becauſe Rules are ſtrengthned by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and precepts are more effectual being back't with examples, I will bring here a late one, as notable as any the <hi>Venetian</hi> Hiſtory can afford, which is this: A Church-man commended by the Arch Duke of <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> to the Abbot <hi>Grimani</hi> in <hi>Venice,</hi> in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots abſence, at a Play received one day a box on the ear from one of the Nobles called <hi>Querini,</hi> about a ſeat, of which the fault was laid to this laſt; but becauſe the other was not a man to diſpute it with a Noble, he went out and complained of it to <hi>Grimani,</hi> who as ſoon as he heard of it, run im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to the Play-houſe, but it was too late, however he met <hi>Querini</hi> in the ſtreet, and after few complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, namely, that he ought to have had a reſpect to him; the other not returning him a ſatisfactory an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, he gave him a cuff on the ear;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57548:104"/>but immediately they were parted, and very ſhortly after the Church-man was cudgell'd, whereat the Abbot was highly incenſed, yet the friends of both ſides did what they could to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them; which they did ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but not in effect, for not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Querini</hi> with ſeveral men waited for <hi>Grimani</hi>'s coming out of a houſe which he was in, as he knew't by his <hi>Gondola</hi>'s being there, and other infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; but it hapned that <hi>Pietro Grimani,</hi> one of the Abbots Brothers; being there alſo came out, and as he began to call for the <hi>Gondola,</hi> he was ſaluted with a volley of ſhot, but not hurt, and ſome who were with him returned the like towards the place whence they had received theirs; at the hearing of which the Abbot was alarm'd, and having ſaid, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Brother, he came down, and went preſently into his boat, having ordered thoſe men that were with him to range about the place; and they were not gone very far, but ſome of them lighted upon a man, of whom having enquired what he did there, he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57548:105"/>ſaid, as he was going home, he had been wounded in the leg by the way; <hi>Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mani</hi> hearing of it, by all means deſired him to come into his boat, either to take a lodging with him that night, for it was late, where he ſhould be ſure of a good Chyrurgion, or elſe he would carry him to his own houſe; the other refuſed it abſolutely, but of neceſſity they would have him to come in; and when he was in the Boat, the other knew him, though in a diſguiſe, to be <hi>Querini,</hi> who had been wounded by ſome of <hi>Pietro Grimani</hi>'s men, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken by his upon the Abbots coming out; away they carry him into <hi>Grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>'s Palace, where a Council was held by the three Brothers, what they ſhould do with him. <hi>Giovanni</hi> (as it hath been reported ſince) a man of a mild nature, repreſented the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the preſent occaſion to do a generous and glorious action, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to uſe him well and kindly if he would ſtay, if not, to carry him ſafely to his own houſe; but it being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the others, that in this he was the aggreſſour, and that ſince,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57548:105"/>for all the late agreement, he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf to be unreconcileable, was the ſureſt for them to make him away, and ſo it was done; neither could it be heard of ſince, what was become of his body: The Senate upon complaint ordered <hi>Grimani</hi> to appear, which they refuſed, whereupon ſentence was paſt againſt them for contempt of the Court, and declared convinced of the fact, by reaſon of their flight, and the houſe to be pulled down; which was effected: the other two lay private, but the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot got together a conſiderable number of people, and plundered ſeveral houſes of the Noblemen, and burnt others, doing a great deal of miſchief up and down; and after retiring himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into the Arch Dukes Countries, and other times into the <hi>Mantoan,</hi> both theſe Princes being his intimate friends; at whoſe earneſt ſollicitations the Republick weary of the troubles he made ſeveral parts of the Country to ſuffer, gave him and all leave to come in; ſince which time <hi>Giovanni</hi> died, as I ſaid before; the Abbot alſo is dead not long ſince, whom two of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57548:106"/>his Siſters married to Noblemen would not ſuffer a Jeſuite to come nigh to confeſs him, as I heard from him that was kept out, a ſign that ſeveral of the Nobility have no kindneſs for that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: So that of the three Brothers, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro</hi> is left alone; all theſe troubles have brought low that Family.</p>
               <p>And let this be ſaid by the by, to ſhew how far animoſities can go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Noble <hi>Venetians.</hi> Now I muſt ſpeak of the dependency, and good or bad intelligencies of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick with other Princes. This is the moſt difficult, and moſt important part which a Miniſter can treat of, ſeeing it is no queſtion to treat of clear, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and viſible things, but of thoſe affections which are hidden in the heart of men, hard to be diſcovered in Princes, but hardeſt of all in a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, which hath a mixture of ſo many tempers and heads, in whom is to be ſeen a palpable difference of judgement and affection: however ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be made of it about the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt, which do ſet forth the minds of men; for by the effects we
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57548:106"/>judge of the affection, as this in Princes is over-ruled by their intereſt.</p>
               <p>Firſt, With the Pope the Republick is glad to keep a good correſpondency, and upon certain occaſions ſhe would perſwade him of her good intentions, not ſo much to take away the bad opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which ſeveral Popes had of the Republick, as not to be croſſed by them in the Tithes or Tenth parts which they receive from the Clergy, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther benefits of the ſame nature; beſides that, part of the State of <hi>Venice</hi> lyes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the attempts of the Pope by the way of the <hi>Poteſine,</hi> which is an open Country expoſed to any incurſions, and wherein is no ſtrong holds, only ſome Valleys, which being once paſſed by an Army, they could find all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of neceſſary proviſions to make it ſubſiſt, and could without any hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance (except there were an Army in the field) run to the very Gates of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona</hi> and <hi>Padoa,</hi> which Hoſtilities would go nigh to work ſome Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the State, at leaſt an alteration in the affections of ſubjects, whom diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and oppreſſions make very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57548:107"/>deſirous of changes and novelties, eſpecially if they did not ſuddenly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that protection which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from their Superiours; beſides that the very name of the Pope, and the intereſt he hath with the Subjects of thoſe States, which own his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by the means of Monks, Fryars, and Emiſſaries, who would work ſcruples in their minds, and ſo weaken their hearts and their hands, beſide that; ſome other neighbour Prince might be induced out of ſome averſion to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> or their own intereſt (as we have ſeen the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to be) to ſhare in the ſpoyl, or out of a perſwaſion of the juſtice of the Popes Armes. All this the Republick is well informed of, as alſo of the pretenſions of the Church upon the <hi>Poteſine,</hi> which hath been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred from the Dukedome of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> beſides ſeveral other claims upon the Patriarchal of <hi>Aquileia,</hi> and the liberty of the City of <hi>Zeneda,</hi> and upon ſome other Sea-places. Out of theſe conſiderations the Republick endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as handſomly as ſhe can to keep a fair correſpondency (though 'twere
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57548:107"/>but in ſhew) with the Pope, with ſome eaſie demonſtrations of it, as to make the Relations of Popes Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Venice:</hi> And although ſhe doth not ſue for the friendſhip of many Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, as it was done before, yet ſhe hath ſome there born within the State, who do the Republick all the Services they can, neither doth the Republick altogether neglect their friendſhip, though 'twere for nothing elſe but to have an account what paſſes in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinals and elſwhere; yet Popes have much complained of the Republick, by reaſon of the loſſes which the Ships of the Subjects of the Church have ſuffered from Pyrates, for want of keeping a <hi>Squadra</hi> of Ships or Gallyes for the ſecurity of the <hi>Yolfe,</hi> as <hi>Venetians</hi> are obliged to do, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that alliance and friendſhip which the Republick hath formerly contracted with Proteſtants and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med States; ſo by reaſon of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which ſhe aſſumes over Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal perſons, for they give thoſe Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whom they ſend Governours into places power to be Keepers, Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57548:108"/>Lawgivers, and Judges over the Clergy within their Juriſdiction and things belonging to them; however the breaches which upon theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts have been between them, were ever made up one way or other, and the <hi>Venetian</hi> Subjects by the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary care of the Senate kept in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as before. And at preſent the Pope and the Republick do well agree, having very lately obtained not only his Gallies, and ſeveral ſums of money, and number of men, but alſo the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of ſome Monaſteries, whoſe Revenues fell into the hands of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</p>
               <p>With the Emperour the Republick hath no great friendſhip, there being old grudges upon the account of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſcocchi,</hi> and the great troubles ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Maximilian</hi> and <hi>Charls</hi> the V. of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> neither doth ſhe eſteem him much, knowing that his forces alone are not able to hurt her, as we have ſeen when the laſt war was carried on between them, for the <hi>Venetians</hi> fell luſtily upon the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>places of the Emperour; ſo that upon
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57548:108"/>occaſion the Republick hath not only rejoyced at his troubles, but alſo hath given Counſels, (and ſome think Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys) to his enemies, as 'twas done in the Wars of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> if we will believe what the <hi>Auſtrians</hi> ſay, who adde, that when the late Prince Palatine was crowned King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> there paſſed a good correſpondency between him and the Republick, and that ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Venice</hi> to that King were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, full of kind and affectionate expreſſions, whereby the intercepters made a diſcovery of the ſupplies he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thence: Now upon this and other accounts the Republick will ever be jealous of the greatneſs and proſperity of the Emperour, that is of the preſent family for the hereditary Countries joyned to the Imperial Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and that union which a wiſe and high ſpirited Emperour can make of ſeveral Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> to his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, will render him formidable to the Republick, which for all this gives an outward ſhew of friendſhip and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the Emperour, whoſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions joyning with great part of theirs
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57548:109"/>makes them to miſtruſt him, and wiſh him to fall rather then to riſe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>With the Crown of <hi>France</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick had of old a great correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and ſhe renewed it, ſince the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were grown ſo potent in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly,</hi> and ſo dangerous to the Liberties of it, with an intent thereby to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the affairs of it, and to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Court ſo potent and ſo abſolute as that is. The truth is, there hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been a great friendſhip, as long as it might conſiſt with their intereſt; for then and when the French Power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came too great, they fenced againſt it, only to keep themſelves from being ſwallowed up with it, which the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſelf-preſervation will allow to any State: And as in the preſent Turkiſh VVar they have ſomtimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſumms of money from thence, and men, though not ſo much as they wiſhed for, or their neceſſities required, yet this hath laid upon them a further obligation to continue in that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which hath not been interrupted with fallings out about places, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57548:109"/>and intereſts, as it hath happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them with the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> Hence it is that in the troubles of <hi>Monferrat</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Republick gave the <hi>French</hi> ſome ſupplyes of monies, and other encouragements againſt the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> whoſe intereſts, inclination and manners, providence hath made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the former; And when they ſaw the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed another way, they made uſe of theirs againſt them, and they laid ſo much to heart the taking of <hi>Vercelli</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> that the Republick by the means of her Ambaſſadours did her utmoſt to engage all great Princes to force the <hi>Spaniard</hi> to a reſtitution of it: This I ſpeak concerning that which is paſt, in time of peace, for no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is to be drawn from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dealings, becauſe by reaſon of the War they ſtand in need of every Neighbour, and ſo muſt keep fair with all.</p>
               <p>The Republick is well affected to <hi>England,</hi> omitting no occaſion of doing a pleaſure to it, and upon good grounds
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57548:110"/>too, for in times of War ſhe hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thence, men, ſhips and ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, though not in the proportion ſhe deſired; yet <hi>England</hi> is ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed towards it, out of a principle of generoſity, charity, and ſome intereſt, that upon occaſion ſhe may expect help and protection from thence; as it was made appear to the world, when <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth fell out with the Republick; neither doth the difference of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obſtruct ſuch an inclination, the Republick being very politick, and of all other States of <hi>Italy,</hi> caring leaſt for the Pope.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> is the Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi> whom the Republick hath ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter union with, for there he is eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as for the valour which all the Princes of that Family are endowed with, ſo for their ſtrength, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and abſolute Authority, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick putting a great deal of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them, and upon all occaſions they will unite their Counſel, and their Forces in the defence one of another; and there was never more joy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Venice</hi> for the ſucceſs of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57548:110"/>State, as for the victories of the late Duke, manifeſted openly, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on publick places; and although there hapned ſome little miſunderſtanding between them from the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>'s part after the ſentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication was fulminated againſt them, it was ſoon rectified, and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Republick receives conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſupplies from thence in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Candia,</hi> he not onely entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Forces in their ſervice, but alſo having lent them his General <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs Villa,</hi> who ſince hath been called home.</p>
               <p>The Republick loves alſo the <hi>Gran Duke of Toſcany</hi> for their common ends, which they ſay, are tending to the preſervation of the publick liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> and are both concerned to bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the Pope, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Milan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All their correſpondency with <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa</hi> is from that ancient emulation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both, and for their common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, which is to promote Trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: And now the <hi>Genoeſi</hi> are ſo degenerated, and the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſo
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57548:111"/>buſied, that the grounds of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer jealouſies are extinct, and their enmities changed into a deſire of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the publick liberty, and their own in particular; eſpecially the <hi>Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſi,</hi> who have reaſon to be affraid of their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Of <hi>Mantoa,</hi> the Republick is very tender, for he is their next neighbour, who in ſome kind, though he be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and ſoveraign, ſtands under her protection. The late Duke was by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Nobles called the Son of the Republick; he was often at <hi>Venice</hi> converſing every day with ſome of the Nobles, eſpecially with the <hi>Grimani,</hi> of whom they had no jealouſie, as they have of their Princes and their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours; it is true, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was done in publick more then in private, though in both.</p>
               <p>With the Dukes of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> the Republick keeps fair for the common preſervation, and the more, that theſe two Families are of late fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to be for the <hi>French</hi> intereſt, though of late a petty diſcontent appeared with the former,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57548:111"/>upon the account of his Brother; and theſe Princes do ſeldom act of their own heads, but they follow the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others.</p>
               <p>They ſtand well affected to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> not ſo much out of any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination and conformity of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, for in this, there is a vaſt differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but upon the account of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, for upon occaſion <hi>Venice</hi> hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from thence Souldiers, Armes, Ammunition and Ships; and although they be at a conſiderable diſtance one from another, yet the conveniency of the Sea doth favour their communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And this friendſhip is grounded chiefly upon the common jealouſie they have both of the houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> from whoſe obedience the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were forced to withdraw, and againſt which the <hi>Venetians</hi> have an intereſſed and politick antipathy; out of this conſideration they have had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency to allow ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> men the liberty of their Preſſes, even in things about Religion, who have there great Ware-houſes; and who alſo are wink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in the exerciſe of their Religion:
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57548:112"/>Yet to this I muſt add, how the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> jealouſie of the houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> is much decreaſed, to give place to a new one of a neerer and more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Neighbour, the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> intereſt lying at preſent very low in the world; though the <hi>Venetians</hi> matter not very much that growing power, becauſe it keeps at a diſtance from them, and they have enough to do elſewhere.</p>
               <p>With <hi>Spain</hi> the Republick never had nor hath at this day any real friendſhip; and whenſoever there hath been any concurrence of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and Forces, they were meerly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it by their intereſt and ſecurity: the truth is, as often as ſhe could ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly croſs the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> deſigns ſhe hath done it, as it hath appeared upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſions about the affairs of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan, Germany,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> but eſpecially in the caſes of the <hi>Valteline,</hi> and of <hi>Sabionetta,</hi> neither have they neglected in the Courts of other Princes any thing which might preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> intereſt; and indeed that enmity is mutual and reciprocal between them, becauſe the <hi>Venetians</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:57548:112"/>having obſerved the great deſigns of that Crown to ſubdue <hi>Italy,</hi> ever ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt it with the utmoſt of their power; and the more, becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their next Neighbours by the way of <hi>Milan,</hi> they were expoſed to her firſt attempts: On the other ſide, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> look't upon <hi>Venice</hi> as the Champion of the <hi>Italian</hi> Liberty, and the great let and hindrance in his way, as being judicious, and able to oppoſe him; neither can he forget that <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> hath diſmembred from the Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Milan,</hi> and united to her State theſe three conſiderable places, <hi>Breſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Bergamo,</hi> and <hi>Crema,</hi> with their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexes and dependencies; and as they are as high, and as crafty as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard;</hi> ſo they would not ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be led by the noſe, or any wayes, to promote his intereſt. No greater demonſtration can be given of this diſaffectedneſs then this is: The Republick hath kept correſpondency and friendſhip with the Enemies of that Crown, eſpecially with Proteſtant Princes and States, whoſe intereſt ſhe knew it was to oppoſe the houſe of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57548:113"/>
                  <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſters at <hi>Venice</hi> have taken notice of it, and confeſſed this diſaffectedneſs of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick to their Monarchy.</p>
               <p>There are two things which do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the good will, or the bad, of one Prince or State towards another; one is the words, and the other the effects: <hi>Spaniards</hi> do complain that the good words of the Republick to them, ever proved empty and fallacious, becauſe the effects have not anſwered thereto: the ſame they ſay of the effects, becauſe (ſay they) in all manner of negotiations either publick or private, upon their account, or that of the Arch Dukes of <hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Inſpruck,</hi> they ever met with great difficulties, even in thoſe things which were eaſie, clear, and ought to have admitted none: But this hath been done with ſo much dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity on the <hi>Venetians</hi> ſide, that as the heart of man is hard to be known, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſatisfied, or ſeemed to be ſo of ſuch dealings, and have been miſtaken therein; but the Nature of the <hi>Venetian,</hi> well known to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other accounts, made them judge
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57548:113"/>aright of their proceedings. But this more is to be obſerved, that although the greateſt part of the <hi>Venetian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen be enemies to <hi>Spain,</hi> which hath proved to them ſo potent and ſo dangerous a Neighbour; yet as that Crown is very liberal in beſtowing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies upon thoſe, who to them may be uſefull, ſo as to get their confidence and friendſhip: and as in ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Nobility there are enmities, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and animoſities (as in a great body, by reaſon of fulneſs of Stomack and ſurfeits, bad humours do abound, and ſo one member or other will ſuffer) becauſe in the diſtribution of places and offices every one cannot have his deſire, ſo in ſome there remains a diſpoſition to make themſelves amends another way, for that which (as they think) their merit and vertue have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly deprived of, and to diſturb others in the adminiſtration of what they have obtained to their prejudice; therefore they dare ſomtimes hearken to propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals from publick Miniſters, and receive their gifts and penſions; I ſay, they dare, for they venture much, it being,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57548:114"/>as I told before, as much as their life is worth; but ſomtimes covetouſneſs, diſcontent, ambition, and deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, make men hazzard all to ſatisfie their paſſions, which an active, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and dexterous Miniſter will lay hold on to the advantage of his Maſters affairs. Beſides other means to preſerve States, two chiefly are the props of them; the one is ſtrength; and the other is Reputation: Strength is the ground, baſis, and foundation of them: and Reputation hath ſo much authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it ſelf, that when Forces have been wanting, this hath not only upheld them, but alſo overcome greater Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Now to conclude this particular, I ſay, that the power of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and his Neighbourhood to the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> beſides that of other Dominions of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and thoſe who depend thereupon, will ever make the Republick look upon him as dangerous to her ſtate and liberty.</p>
               <p>This in time of peace is the right and true ſence of the Republick in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Princes and States I menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, for with the <hi>Swedes, Danes,</hi> and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57548:114"/>
                  <hi>Polanders,</hi> ſhe hath little to do, onely inaſmuch as ſome of them had to deal againſt the houſe of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account ſhe hath been very glad to ſee <hi>Portugal</hi> withdrawn from under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Yoke: But now as change of condition, and the like acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, oblige men to new reſolutions and practiſes; ſo the demonſtration of this, eſpecially diſaffectedneſs, hath been ſuſpended ſince the beginning of the preſent War with the <hi>Turk;</hi> for the <hi>Venetians</hi> having their hands full that way, inſtead of diſobliging, they muſt of neceſſity Court and pleaſe thoſe from whom they may expect ſome ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours: Upon this account they were ſo earneſt in the late War between the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Treaty, to mediate a peace between the two Crowns, thereby to receive ſome aſſiſtance from both, which would be a preſident to others, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the common intereſt of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to act againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the Bulwark of that part of <hi>Chriſtendome:</hi> But this remote intereſt is not ſo ſtrong as a neerer one, for <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Princes have intereſts
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57548:115"/>contrary one ſo another, which oppoſe the carrying on of the great and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick one; for 'tis to be feared, if one Prince did ſend any conſiderable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the Common Enemy, ſome of his Neighbours would take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their abſence, and ſo fall on him at home; after the ſad experience of <hi>Don Sebaſtian,</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> of the Kingdome of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and of other inſtances which Hiſtory relates, Princes have great reaſon ever to ſtand upon their guards. And this it is which expoſes the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Cauſe to ſo many dangers, and that betrays, if I may ſo ſay, the <hi>Venetians</hi> to that dreadful Enemy.</p>
               <p>But ſomething is to be ſaid of the Republicks inclination to the <hi>Turk;</hi> him ſhe ever feared more then ſhe lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom ſhe was content in time of peace to pay a Tribute to for ſome Iſlands, as we ſaid before, that ſhe might be at reſt, and not fall out with ſo potent an Enemy. But the <hi>Gran Signior,</hi> by the Adviſe of that notable States-man <hi>Kupriuli</hi> the <hi>Gran Viſier,</hi> being reſolved upon any account to be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57548:115"/>rid of many <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> becauſe of the frequent mutinings they were fallen into, which proved not only ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to their Princes, but alſo ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence favoured him with an occaſion to execute his reſolution, and withall, to enlarge his Dominions; for the Knights of <hi>Maltha</hi> having made ſome conſiderable price of perſons dear to the <hi>Turk,</hi> he took this pretence to Arm; and though he threatned <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> yet the ſtorm fell upon <hi>Candia,</hi> that Bulwark not only of <hi>Veniee,</hi> but alſo of all <hi>Italy.</hi> Indeed the Republick was never more overſeen in any thing then ſhe was in this; for though they heard of the great preparation the <hi>Turk</hi> made, yet truſting to the peace they had with him at that time, they were ſurprized. The <hi>Turks</hi> landing in that Iſland, and taking <hi>Canea,</hi> it is thought, that in caſe the buſineſs had not ſucceeded, the <hi>Sultan</hi> had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned the attempt, and made the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals head fly off for a pretended ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; but they got their ground and kept it: and as they had thought
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57548:116"/>upon, ſo it fell out; for though the deſign had miſcarried, yet if could not without the loſs of many <hi>Janiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> if it ſucceeded, then a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conqueſt was made, which could not be without the loſs of thouſands of <hi>Janiſaries;</hi> ſo that let the event be what it would, he would ſtill have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to one of his ends; but as it fell out, he had both, not onely he got the place, but alſo loſt 40000 <hi>Janiſaries</hi> in the attempt, or a while after, and in time (unhappily for Chriſtians) that excellent Iſland is wholly fallen into their barbarous hands, the City <hi>Candia</hi> only excepted, which for theſe two laſt years hath been ſo hardly put to it by the cloſe ſiege they have laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; in the defence of which the <hi>Venetians</hi> have gotten a great deal of credit, and if it ſhould happen to be loſt, Chriſtians would incur a great ſhame, having had a ſufficient warning to relieve it.</p>
               <p>'Tis a wonder indeed that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick hath holden out ſo long that place againſt the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces; the more, that the whole Kingdome of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57548:116"/>was loſt in leſs then a years time; the reaſon of it may be, not only that diverſion which the <hi>Turks</hi> have had elſewhere, and that extraordinary care the Republick hath taken to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it from time to time with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but chiefly her application and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to keep the Maſtery and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Sea, without which ſhe had received no benefit by the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>This conſideration puts me upon an inquiry of the fitteſt and more ſuitable means of ſucceſsfully carrying on the War againſt that common Enemy of <hi>Chriſtendome;</hi> for certainly hitherto there have been miſtakes upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by reaſon of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſtanding only upon the defenſive, and ſuffering their ground to be the only Soyle of War; for as in his preparations for ſuch a war, he hath had the help of his whole Empire, ſo he hath the ſame to back him in the carrying of it on, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead that if diverſions were made, Armies could in part be kept at the Enemies charges, and uſe or ſpoile thoſe proviſions which are conveyed
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57548:117"/>to his Camp, or to ſupply the wants of other places, or which make thoſe wherein they grow to ſubſiſt; neither are people of the Countries where ſuch diverſions are made into, able to pay charges and taxes as before, and if they go about to exact it, they are apt to fall into mutinies, of which an enemy may draw ſome advantage. Now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and late experience ſhews us, how advantagious is this manner of war: Is War to be made againſt the <hi>Romans?</hi> then, ſaith <hi>Hannibal, Italy</hi> muſt be the ſeat of it; for thus, ſaid he to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> we ſhall employ thoſe means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, which in other places they will make uſe of againſt us: Is <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> to be forced out of <hi>Italy?</hi> then <hi>Scipio</hi> muſt go with a <hi>Roman</hi> Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Africa.</hi> In a word, when the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> (who knew very well how to make war) had it with any one, they carried it home to them. Is not this here the way which the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> have uſed one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? and the <hi>Swedes</hi> underſtand it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably well. Lately the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> fell upon the Dukedom of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:57548:117"/>to draw the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> out of <hi>Poland;</hi> and what doth he do? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of going to defend <hi>Bremen,</hi> he marches in perſon into <hi>Holſtein, Jut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Denmark,</hi> and every one knows how well he ſped. I do not deny but that the diverſity of Countries, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Nations, and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with ſome conjunctures, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſometimes diverſity of methods in ſuch things; but I am perſwaded that what I have already mentioned, might with ſucceſs be uſed againſt the <hi>Turk.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to make war againſt him in <hi>Hungary,</hi> is to take him where his ſtrength lyes, for his ſtronger places and beſt Souldiers are in thoſe parts; and thereby occaſion is given him to make uſe of his beſt Militia's which are leavied in the Countries he hath taken from <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Hungary, Walla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Moldavia,</hi> and now <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and he hath beſides, all his Empire to back him.</p>
               <p>Now methinks, to carry it on more effectually, he is to be fallen upon where he is weakeſt. I know, that to
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57548:118"/>take it generally, that Empire hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready loſt much of its ſtrength (as I will ſhew by and by) almoſt all the Old <hi>Janiſaries</hi> and <hi>Spahies,</hi> wherein conſiſted its great forces, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in the <hi>Perſian, Hungarian</hi> and <hi>Candia</hi> wars, according to the deſign of the forenamed <hi>Gran Viſier;</hi> ſo that now they are forced to make uſe of raw Souldiers, and new Militia's, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are not ſo mutinous as the others were, but withall, are not ſo couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo well diſciplined, nor experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: But that which I inſiſt upon moſt of all, is, that he is not ſo ſtrong by Sea as by Land, wanting good ſhips, but above all able Seamen, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Sea-officers, that Empire hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever employed it ſelf by Land more then by Sea, which they have mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed onely out of neceſſity; ſo that the few skilful Seamen they have (if any at all) are <hi>Renegadoes</hi> of ſeveral <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Nations. Now experience hath ſhewed us, that he is to be purſued by Sea more then by Land, becauſe there he is the weakeſt, ſeeing we have ſeen the <hi>Venetians</hi> alone, or at leaſt weakly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57548:118"/>by the Knights of <hi>Maltha, &amp;c.</hi> have of late very often obtained by Sea Glorious Victories over that Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>But to make ſome overture of that which upon occaſion might be more enlarged upon, I conceive it were well to get a matter of twenty five, or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty good ſhips, carrying aboard a Land-Army, not under fifteen, nor above twenty thouſand, to land them upon occaſion in one place or other, and in caſe the firſt and ſecond attempt ſhould miſs, yet according as the wind ſhould prove, the Fleet might in twenty-four houſes be fifty, eighty, or an hundred miles from that place; ſo that at laſt one place or other could be ſurprized, or at leaſt it would keep the enemy every where in continual alarums, whereat they ſhould have a conſtant diverſion, and grow weary of being kept upon a conſtant duty, wherein alſo they could happen to be remiſs and neglectful of. By theſe means the communication between their Iſlands in the <hi>Arcipelago</hi> ſhould be interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and alſo ſome of them whence they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57548:119"/>have their Gallies could be ſnatched out of their hands; and this in time might have more general influences upon the the ſubjects, or rather ſlaves of that Empire, conſiſting of ſo many Nations, who are all breathing after liberty, whoſe deſire after it would thereby increaſe, be encouraged and countenanced.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide a conſiderable number of Gallies ſhould conſtantly be cruiſing upon their Coaſts, eſpecially of <hi>Morea,</hi> to hinder the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ports, and the gathering of any Ships or Gallies: But that which I account to be of the greateſt concernment would be to ſtop the mouth of the <hi>Dardanels,</hi> for thereby the City of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all manner of ſupplies which ſhe receives from <hi>Morea,</hi> could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to wants and ſtraights; Hence ſhould ariſe Seditions and Mutinies in it, which to them would prove dangerous; the more, that there are in it ſo many thouſands ſlaves, who ever watch for an opportunity of cutting their Maſters throats; and all theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57548:119"/>could mightily be increaſed if monies were given to the <hi>Coſtacks</hi> to come into the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> who though they be a perfidious, yet they are a mercenary people, and a ſudden irruption of theirs could ſtrike a great terrour into that City (for of all Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, theſe ſhe is the moſt afraid of) which might afford a fair opportunity to <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to attempt ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thing on this ſide.</p>
               <p>And I do not think that any great difficulties could hinder the execution of this deſign: I know that every great undertaking, eſpecially in matters of war, is ſubject to lets and hinderances; which either have been foreſeen, and ſo men have prepared againſt it, or elſe ſuch as fell out when they were not lookt for, which muſt not be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, ſeeing they eſcaped the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of men judicious and experienced in their wayes, who at leaſt have ſome general remedies applyable to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar accidents: But this I think is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and eaſie, conſidering the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it, for here is propoſed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides the Land Army, but
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57548:120"/>that which the <hi>Venetians</hi> alone, or with ſmall aſſiſtance, have already done, namely, cruiſing of the Seas, and ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the mouth of the <hi>Dardanels,</hi> as I mentioned in the beginning of this Diſcourſe: So that if to the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Armata were joyned the <hi>Italian</hi> Galleys, namely, the five of the Pope, the ſeven of <hi>Maltha,</hi> the eight of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> beſides thoſe of particular men in it, the four of the Gran Duke, or at leaſt the two which are fit for ſervice, and thoſe of <hi>Naples, Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignia,</hi> with ſeveral privateers, which would be ſet forth, with half of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gallies, the other half being not only ſufficient to ſecure their Coaſts, but alſo to ſcoure thoſe of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and they could order their ſhips which they keep conſtantly, to go where there ſhould be occaſion for them; all theſe joyned together in caſe of a fight, could form a formidable Fleet, and able to carry on the deſigne before expreſſed; but elſe every one, or two of theſe Squadrons at the moſt, could have their poſt together, and courſe appointed them to prevent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57548:120"/>which might ariſe from the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy of ſome Nations, or of ſome other intereſt of State, yet ſo within a diſtance, as they might ſoon be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon occaſion; and as all theſe Forces do belong to Catholick Princes, ſo they would without diſpute give the Pope's Flags the precedency, and obey a General of High Merit and Quality, choſen by common conſent. As to the men of War, they ſhould be half <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and half <hi>Dutch,</hi> with at leaſt ten thouſand men of both Nations, of the fifteen or twenty thouſand, the reſt might be in part <hi>Germans, French, Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, Portuguzes,</hi> and others better uſed to thoſe Climates; or moneys in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of men, and ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the ſame to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by reaſon of their great propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>And in all theſe nothing would be extraordinary beſides the Land Army, for all theſe Princes and States keep conſtantly Gallies and Ships for the ſecurity of their Coaſts and Trade; ſo that this were no more charges to them, then every year they are at;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57548:121"/>and certainly whilſt they keep them in pay, it were as well to put them upon ſome honourable and advantageous ſervice, as to let them be idle at Sea all Summer long. Furthermore, the Prizes which they could make, might contribute much towards the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of theſe Forces; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, if any were made, could ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what help towards the defraying of the war: ſo that it would be an eaſie, and not chargeable enterprize, to get together the Gallies which Princes and States do keep in pay, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadrons, which both Nations do ſend every year into the Straits; for whoſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, if occaſion required, proviſion might be made there. This indeed were noble and chriſtian prudenc, and I doubt not might prove very benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.</p>
               <p>Such a thing, if carried on could give a great pull to the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; what place could not ſuch a Land Army attempt, or rather take; and ſuch a Fleet of brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhips exploit? I verily believe, that
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57548:121"/>this being carried on in a private way, that is, by a man of Note entring into the Service of the Republick, with a matter of twelve or fifteen good men of war, and five or ſix hundred men aboard, could yet produce brave effects; for alas! what I ſay is not out of any hopes that ſuch a thing will take any effect, contrariwiſe I am perſwaded it will not, for Princes do ſeldom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of thoſe Councils which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not the Authors of; it is an eaſie thing to ſhew what could or ought to be done, all the difficulty lies in perſwading to do: But in this I am like one who is much taken with a pleaſant dream, and if this be one, I like it ſo well, that to humour my ſelf, I will make it laſt a little lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>Yet I think it is but realities, if to encourage Chriſtians, I ſhew the grounds and cauſes of the decay of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire and Power: The ground of my Diſcourſe ſhall be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon this known and experienced maxime, <hi>As States and Dominions have been gotten, ſo they muſt be kept,</hi>
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:57548:122"/>whether it be done by Force, Fraud, or fair and plauſible means: And the ſame means which reaſon hath intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, ſucceſſes approved of, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience confirmed, ought to be uſed in the ſettlement and preſervation of of what hath been gotten; a Prince muſt certainly make uſe of the wayes whereby he hath increaſed, enlarged, and ſetled his Empire, as the fitteſt and moſt proper to preſerve it, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the baſis and foundation of it.</p>
               <p>Now it will not be hard for me to ſhew, that of late the <hi>Ottomans</hi> have not followed this maxime, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that this is the cauſe of the preſent decay of their Empire: <hi>Firſt,</hi> their Predeceſſours and great Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours went ever in the head of their Army: Thus they kept their Great Miniſters and Officers in ſubjection, and united, which otherwiſe out of envy, ambition and Covetouſneſs, had fallen out amongſt themſelves; thereby the Army was kept upon duty, and in obedience, and the <hi>Janiſaries</hi> to the obſervation of their Diſcipline: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, the eye of a Prince, who is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57548:122"/>preſent, not only to ſee, but alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to reward merit and valour, is a great encouragement to Souldiers, who ſeeing him according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to ſhare in the hardſhips and dangers of war, do conceive a high eſteem, love and reſpect for him. This muſt be the way of Conquerours (for the reaſon is different about thoſe Princes who are ſetled in their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and who mind no more but to preſerve themſelves, and ſtand onely upon the defenſive) as was practiſed by <hi>Cyrus, Alexander the Great, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius, Caeſar, &amp;c.</hi> and of late by <hi>Charles the eight, Francis the firſt, and Henry the fourth, Kings</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> and by the two late Kings of <hi>Sweden, Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus Adolphus,</hi> and <hi>Charles Guſtavus,</hi> who with their preſence inſpired life, courage and valour into their Armies: By theſe means alſo the <hi>Mahomets, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jazets, Solyman,</hi> and others, did ſo much enlarge their <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire; but their ſucceſſors, who would make war by proxy, found the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of it.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:57548:123"/>
               <p>For when the <hi>Gran Sultan</hi> marched into the field, they were followed by the beſt, and the ſtrength of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: to underſtand this, one muſt know that their perſon was attended by twelve thouſand <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> all choice, valiant and experienced men, who were exactly and duly paid once a month, and made a very formidable body in the field; but now not onely many muſt remain with the Princes perſon, whoſe help their Armies are deprived of, but alſo they have increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their number with men not qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the place as others were; and that which is the worſt, they have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed their pay; beſides which, they had every one a Bow, two ſhirts, and a Sute of Cloathes given them eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year, which now and then they are cheated of; out of the beſt of theſe two hundred are choſen to go by the Princes perſon, and three hundred more about his Lodgings or Tents when he is in the field.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe foot, three thouſand <hi>Spahies</hi> or Horſemen are to march on the <hi>Sultans</hi> right hand, and other
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57548:123"/>three thouſand on the left, all ſelect men; every one of the former is to be attended by five ſervants a horſeback able and fighting men, and the loft are to keep four, or at leaſt three every one, and they are divided into two bodies, every one of which follow their Maſters. Theſe are followed of two other Squadrons of a thouſand horſe, the one doth conſiſt of men of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and condition, who by ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit of theirs have been taken notice of, and raiſed to that degree; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther compoſed only of natural <hi>Turks,</hi> who are ſingularly skill'd in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing, as may be, the handling of a Symeter, Lance, Dart, Horſeman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or the like, and they are obliged to keep every one two ſervants: Beſides this, the ſervants of the great Officers, as Treaſurers, Judges, Counſellours, Bathaws, &amp;c. are to follow the Court, ſome of whom have at leaſt two or three thouſand, which in all cannot amount to leſs then twenty thouſand, and ſeveral others there are who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Court: Now when the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> doth not go into the field, theſe
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57548:124"/>people lye at home, and do no Service in the preſent war. To this I may add, that when the Prince goes himſelf to the War, he gets experience in milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry affairs, and ſo doth not take things upon truſt; he takes notice of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, and of the defects of his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which he applies timely reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies unto, and prevents mutinies, which they are apt to fall into under the command of men, who ſometimes are of no credit in the Armies: and his being conſtantly amongſt Souldiers, raiſes his heart and ſpirit to a high and martial temper, which afterwards put him upon great deſigns: Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, the Forces he keeps at home fall into idleneſs, thence into vices, and ſo grow ſtubborn and Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</p>
               <p>Another important maxime of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire hath been conſtantly to be at War, thereby to keep Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in Exerciſe; but withall, to make a ſhort War with thoſe againſt whom they fell out; So uſually the end of a War hath been with them the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of another, they fell ſuddenly,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57548:124"/>and like a ſtorm upon a Country, and when they had ſeized upon all what they could for the time, ſeeing thoſe parts and their Neighbours began to put themſelves in a conſiderable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence, they preſently clapt up a peace, to ſettle in their new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and to fall upon ſome others who thought them deeply engaged in the preſent War; ſo well they have obſerved that maxime, which ſaith, <hi>If a Prince hath three Enemies, he muſt be ſure to make peace with one, truce with another, but fall with his whole Power upon the third:</hi> Yet of late they have not followed this Rule, whence to them are befallen theſe two great inconveniencies; the one is, that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging a long War with a Nation; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and a conſtant exerciſe have made their Enemies to be good War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers, and ſo the better able to oppoſe them; the other is, that in theſe long Wars they have loſt the beſt and ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their Souldiers by their too much forwardneſs, as we have ſeen by experience in the <hi>Perſian, Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Candia</hi> Wars, as I already
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57548:125"/>obſerved: In few words, I ſay, that the decay of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Empire is cauſed by their Princes ſtaying at home, by their engaging in long Wars, and having given time as well as occaſion to their Neighbours to train up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to War; and by two other things, which are their deſtroying the Lands of their Conqueſts, for the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not manured could not produce neceſſaries for the people of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Towns being ſack't and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were depriv'd of inhabitants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Trade was wholly deſtroyed: The other is, that at laſt they fell a raiſing of fortifications, out of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diſtruſt of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or valour of people, and ſo left in them ſtrong Garriſons, which not only made them weaker in the field, but theſe, like <hi>Hannibal</hi>'s ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, loſt their hearts in the midſt of their pleaſures; and every Town like another <hi>Capua ex Gallis fecit Capones,</hi> as one uſed to ſay, and now their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of 200000 men, are reduced to 30 or 60000, and their Fleets migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily decreaſed in number and power.</p>
               <p>Difficulties diſſwade men from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57548:125"/>reſolutions; and if they be taken, they ſtop and hinder the execution; but one of the greateſt (to wit the ſtrength of the <hi>Turk</hi>) being removed, I think this motion might be carryed on ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully: Indeed the greateſt of all is, how to unite Princes, and perſwade them to concur in this work; for their private intereſts are ſo different, and their affections ſo contrary, that it is a very difficult, if not an impoſſible task to make them agree to it; the reaſon is, that ſome would have the great and publick intereſt to be ſubſervient to their particular ends; for as to the main, it will ever be found to be the right intereſt of every Prince and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian State, to oppoſe the Common Enemy, though I know it to be of ſome more neerly and immediately then of others; yet at laſt the one, as the other, may happen to be involved, not in the danger, but the hurt it ſelf. May be in the late dreadful fire in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> ſuch as were in one part of the City, when the fire was but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part remote from that, did ſay, What's that to us? yet at laſt they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57548:126"/>by it; ſo thoſe who at preſent ſeem to be the furtheſt from the blows, may in time be ſenſible, at the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of the Turkiſh power; and this ſhould make all jealouſies and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities give place to the care of every ones ſecurity. 'Tis indeed a lamentable thing to ſee how often theſe Diviſions have given the Turk occaſion of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his Empire, and how Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have thereby loſt occaſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling him back again; for certain they were the cauſe why no improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made of the victory of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panto;</hi> for it was not enough to have ſtopt the violence of that torrent, but alſo <hi>Cyprus,</hi> which was the occaſion of the Leaguer, ought to have been ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched back from his hands, but the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> thought fit to have it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I ſay of the late betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or if they pleaſe, forſaking of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotzki,</hi> Prince of <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> a fair opportunity was offered to give a great blow to the <hi>Turks,</hi> when the Princes of <hi>Wallachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia</hi> were up to ſhake off his yoke; at the ſame time <hi>Ragotzkie</hi> was up with a conſiderable
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57548:126"/>Army, which being united to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thoſe two Princes, and backed with a conſiderable ſupply from the Emperour, might happened to have freed all thoſe Countries from the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi> dominion. The <hi>Tranſylvanian</hi> asked ſome aſſiſtance, but was refuſed, why? he was a Proteſtant, and the Jeſuitical Councel given to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, deſired his diſtruction, in hopes that the Country ſhould be forced to put her ſelf into their hands for prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but were diſappointed; for the Turk not only ſettled his authority in <hi>Wallachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia,</hi> but alſo got <hi>Waradin,</hi> and ſubjected <hi>Tranſylvania,</hi> and quickly after came into <hi>Hungary,</hi> and got <hi>Newhauſel,</hi> which he could not have effected if he had not been kept at play in <hi>Tranſylvania:</hi> So the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> for all they can ſay, muſt be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what experience teaches them now, for their not joyning more nearly with the Emperour in the late <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> War, and not making a ſtrong di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion towards <hi>Candia</hi> and the <hi>Arci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago:</hi> But men matter not much how heavy the burthen falls upon others, if
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57548:127"/>themſelves do not lye under it. I do not ſay this to excuſe the Emperour for making peace after ſo glorious a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory obtained at the <hi>Raab,</hi> and not including the <hi>Venetians</hi> in't, or not ſo much as communicating it to them, or to any other concerned States, neither for not aſſiſting them now; for both the Emperour and the <hi>Venetians</hi> may eaſily ſee their fault, and how the Turk makes fools of both, for he hath no ſooner done with one, but he begins with another. Therefore this ſhould open the eyes of Chriſtian Princes, ſo as to make them unanimouſly oppoſe, before it be too late, that enemy of the Chriſtian name.</p>
               <p>But before I leave this Subject, I muſt in few words anſwer the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and, I think, the chief Objection of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> who drive a great Trade in <hi>Turky:</hi> Some will ſay, <hi>If any way we do aſſiſt the Venetians, then all our Trade in the</hi> Levant <hi>is ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> But I ſay, though ſuch a help as we mentioned before, be of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> yet it is not conſiderable to <hi>England;</hi> and I beleive
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57548:127"/>the Turk is wiſe enough to give no ſuch provocations, as to draw thence a greater power and ſtronger Fleets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf; beſides that, I believe that Chriſtians do much miſtake him in this, for he is well acquainted with his intereſt, and he knows how benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Trading is to his Country, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which he could not gather ſo much moneyes as he doth; ſo that he would be as loth to break off trading with <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>England</hi> is to break with him; and he would be found as ready to renew it with others, as others would be to renew it with him, if once he were driven upon his own ground, for he is as much concerned. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, as it is certain, that in <hi>England</hi> in Q. <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wares were as cheap for all the War as in time of peace; ſo it may be by the Turkiſh Commodities, by reaſon of the prizes which could be made of them; and certainly if Merchants would but be honeſt and content with a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gain, things would be as cheap as before, for the Turkiſh Subjects muſt ſell openly or underhand; and as there
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57548:128"/>would be no open Markets, they would part with their Wares at low rates, rather then not to ſell them at all &amp; ever to have them upon their hands: And let this be ſpoken as to <hi>Holland</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. One thing, I confeſs, were fit for <hi>England</hi> to obſerve, namely, That the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould contribute the ſame help againſt the Turk, to be in the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegory at the <hi>Divan,</hi> to the end they ſhould not have a free Trade in the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were forbidden it.</p>
               <p>One thing more I muſt ſay as to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> which are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Dominions, and from thoſe Parts which ſhould be the ſeat of War: I confeſs, that to avoyd breaking with the Turk, 'twere better and more convenient to carry on the deſign, if ſome gallant and experienced men would, with the leave or winking at of both States, enter into the Service of the Reipublick, and mind only that ſame thing. However, the caſe being as I ſtated it from the beginning, and ſome Princes and States of thoſe Parts contributing to the payment of part of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57548:128"/>the Forces, could eaſily upon occaſion afford them good and convenient har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, with all neceſſary accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for winter quarters in ſo plentiful a Country: Or elſe, ſuppoſe it were but to try for one Summer, they ſhould go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and carry proviſions for ſeveral months. But I muſt engage no further upon this Diſcourſe, my whole deſign being onely to make ſuch a motion, which being thought upon by wiſe and concerned perſons, might be brought to ſome maturity, reduced to a good form, and in all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances thereof laid in ſuch a way, as might beſt of all ſute the importance of the matter, and become the wiſdom of the undertakers.</p>
               <p>By what I ſay of the great intereſt of all Chriſtians againſt the Common Enemy, I do not intend by any means to prejudice another great concern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſtians themſelves, and that is the Proteſtant intereſt, which is grounded not onely upon differences about Religion, but alſo upon reaſon of State; for alas! as the world goes now men are not much acted with
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57548:129"/>principles of Religion, except there be with it one thing or other of temporal concernment. Policy is the great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile of the actions of States-men; but if Religion be brought in, 'tis more the name then the power of it, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the rule of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> as a ſhew and a pretence only: Therefore I ſay, that Proteſtant Princes and States are not to neglect the Proteſtant Cauſe, in the defence of which lyes the ſafety of their perſons, and preſervation of their States and Authority; for as ever it is the Popes intereſt, ſo his conſtant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, are either to bring again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Church all thoſe who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Proteſtant Religion, or elſe to deſtroy them. And as it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for a man to wiſh that every one would be of his Religion; So he is countenanced and aſſiſted by thoſe Princes who are of his perſwaſion, wherein the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> hath been ſo forward, that ('tis believed) thereby ſhe hath brought upon her ſelf the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy hand of God, which at preſent hath ſo much humbled her.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:57548:129"/>
               <p>I further aſſert another truth, that the Pope is more dangerous to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants then the Turk; <hi>Firſt,</hi> by reaſon of the diſtance of places; for Providence hath ſo ſeated the States of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, that, excepted <hi>Tranſylvania</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> which yet belongs in part to a Roman Catholick Prince, he cannot come nigh to them: but the Pope and his upholders are cloſe by, and ſo the more formidable, becauſe in ſome ſence he is a domeſtick enemy, who ever is at work how to bring out ſome occaſion, which when he ſeeth he ſoon layes hold on't; which advantage the Turk is deprived of, for though an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was offered to him, it would be loſt before he were ready to make uſe of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Turk comes in by meer force and violence, which his Neighbours being warned of, do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt with the utmoſt of their Power; but the Pope hath his <hi>Devices</hi> and his <hi>Depths,</hi> whereby he plots and contrives deſigns deſtructive to others; he hath his Thunderbolts of Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication (which Proteſtants, and at preſent ſome other States laugh at.)
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57548:130"/>He takes upon him to diſpenſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects from the obedience they owe to their Soveraigns, and an abſolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in every Eccleſiaſtical affair, and over all Eccleſiaſtical perſons in the Dominions of others (a thing ſo unjuſt, that ſome States of his perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, eſpecially <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> have denyed it to him.) He attributes to himſelf an unqueſtionable authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Conſciences, of binding and looſing all ſpiritual things, under which name of ſpirituals, all moral things may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or indirectly be reduced; ſo that thereby he muſt take from Princes in their own Dominions, the Sword of Juſtice, and puniſh Adulterers, Thieves, Murtherers, and all crimes expreſſed or implyed in the Decalogue, or Ten Commandments: And what elſe is this but to diveſt Princes of the Authority they ought to have within their own Dominions, and to pull down their Tribunals and Seats of Juſtice, to ſet up his own upon their ruines. From this let every one judg how much all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are concerned to oppoſe this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and uſurped Authority, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57548:130"/>of their own. Beſides all this he takes upon himſelf to diſpenſe with divine Precepts, and yet he abſolutely commands the obſervation of his own under pain (as he ſaith) of eternal damnation: And when all theſe things cannot ſerve, he hath <hi>Ravaillacs,</hi> and ſuch Emiſſaries who have vowed a blind obedience to his orders; ſo that St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Sword doth cut what St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Keyes cannot open. But the Turk hath none of theſe helps.</p>
               <p>Moreover, The Turk is acted only by a principle of ambition, but the Pope acts out of a deſire of revenge: The Turk pretends no right upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but that which the Sword gives him; but the Pope pretends a divine and ſpiritual right made over to him by Chriſt, and ſo looks upon all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as rebels to him, becauſe they are withdrawn from his obedience, and conſequently he is the more bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to them; and whereſoever he could reach any of them, he made the Sword, the Fire, the Gibbet, and Priſon, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of his vengeance: So that when a hundred thouſand have had
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57548:131"/>their throats cut in one night at <hi>Rome,</hi> there hath been for it publick and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary expreſſions of joy. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> The Turk hath no Inquiſition within his States; contrariwiſe, by the means of an yearly Tribute, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows Proteſtants that liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience which is denyed them by ſome Princes of the Roman perſwaſion; and this very thing hath ſtrengthened his intereſt in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where whole Towns have ſomtimes ſubmitted to his yoke: ſo that in this the Popes and Turk's intereſts are contrary, for the former will admit of no ſuch tollerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſequently by reaſon of his intereſt, is more dangerous to Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants then the other.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this, I do no wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from what I ſaid before of the common intereſt of all Chriſtians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Turk, provided the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant can be ſecured, which can be done no better, then by uniting the whole body under one head, ſettling between all the Members a good correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, grounded upon their common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and ſafety, having them all knitted
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57548:131"/>in affection, and as much as may be in judgment, and concerning themſelves in the affairs one of another, being ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hearted and charitable to thoſe members who are perſecuted for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſake, aſſiſting each other, and by no means ſuffering one Prince or State of the ſame profeſſion to be oppreſſed upon any pretences whatſoever; and they muſt watch and oppoſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of thoſe who are able and likely to carry on the <hi>Roman</hi> Intereſt, out of the diſcovery which may be made of their Councils: and in all theſe things Proteſtants ought to carry themſelves unanimouſly and with vigour.</p>
               <p>After this, there is no danger for the chief amongſt them, and thoſe who are able and can conveniently aſſiſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> to do it, the queſtion being not to aſſiſt the Pope, but a Republick, which hath had ſeveral fallings out with the See of <hi>Rome</hi> about priviledges and juriſdiction, and which is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the point of <hi>Inquiſition;</hi> beſides that this is a matter of State, and not of Religion; and if the Pope were in the ſame condition as <hi>Venice,</hi> he might be
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57548:132"/>aſſiſted, <hi>Salva Conſcientia,</hi> by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Princes, juſt as are the outworks of a Town by thoſe who are in the Town, who have reaſon to concern themſelves in their preſervation, for if once they be taken the Enemy will draw nearer to the City, and make uſe of them againſt it; ſo that when any Chriſtian Prince doth repel the violence offered to another, he doth nothing elſe but meet with that which is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt him; he haſtens to quench the fire which is in his neighbours houſe, for fear it ſhould come into his own; and gives his helping hand to make Sconces, Dams, and other oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions to the Sea, which having once drowned his Neighbours Country, would quickly over-flow his own. In a word, diverſity of Religion, in this caſes is not a ſufficient ground to hinder the <hi>Venetians</hi> from being aſſiſted by thoſe who make profeſſion of another, ſeeing ſuch a ſuccour is to be employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Tyrant who hath uſurped ſo many members of the Chriſtian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and who by his Religion is bound by a perpetual vow to deſtroy <hi>Chriſtian
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57548:132"/>Religion,</hi> and all the profeſſors of it.</p>
               <p>To this I add, that if the whole Iſland of <hi>Candia</hi> was once loſt, whole <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> would feel the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of it, even thoſe parts which are the moſt remote; for their Trade ſhould ſuffer much by it, becauſe there could be no paſſing by the <hi>Arcipelago,</hi> without being expoſed to the mercy of the <hi>Turks,</hi> and of the Rowers of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary;</hi> and as the paſſage is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous between thoſe Iſlands, who knows what Tolls might be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Shipping that go by, which ſhould be forced to ſubmit to it, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to run danger of Shipwrack: but nearer countries would be more ſenſible of it, for <hi>Candia</hi> which is the bullwark of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> in thoſe parts being once taken, <hi>Zant, Corfu</hi> and <hi>Cefalonia</hi> could not hold out, and ſo nothing could hinder the <hi>Turk</hi> from falling upon the Kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the Iſlands of <hi>Sicily</hi> and and <hi>Sardigna,</hi> then the Sea-coaſts of the Popes Dominions ſhall lye open both towards the <hi>Gulf</hi> and the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean;</hi>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:57548:133"/>ſo ſhall the Gran Dukes, and the <hi>Genoeſes</hi> Dominions, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Iſland <hi>Corſica;</hi> ſo that as <hi>Italy</hi> is the neareſt and the moſt concerned Country, it is to be admired, that the Princes of it do not beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more then they do, to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, and give good example to thoſe who are further of, who think it not fit for them to awake, whil'ſt thoſe who lye nearer to the danger are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleep.</p>
               <p>But before I make an end of this, it will not be amiſs, if I endeavour to ſatisfie the curioſity which ſome may have to know the preſent condition of the Republick; I do not mean their War-like poſture; for the number of their Ships, Gallies, Galleaſſes, and other ſort of Shipping, is known to be very great; ſo are their Land, but eſpecially the Sea Forces: but I mean how they are at home, whether hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or dejected, rich or poor. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the firſt, That there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, nor any other State in the World, which hath had, and ſtill doth retain ſo much of the Ancient
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57548:133"/>
                  <hi>Roman</hi> Courage, Patience and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, which Vertues have been put to hard tryals in their Wars with <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> with <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Emperour, when all was loſt, except <hi>Venice, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doa</hi> and <hi>Trevigi,</hi> and of late in the Wars with the <hi>Turk;</hi> yet for all this, they bear it out, and are ſo undaunted, as to refuſe to condeſcend to any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions diſhonourable, or very diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Republick. As for their Riches, the publick Treaſure muſt neceſſarily be exhauſted; for what State in <hi>Europe</hi> could without a conſiderable diminution, carry on a War againſt ſo formidable an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my for about twenty five years time? I will grant, it is in part of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies laid out, as of the circular blood which comes again to the heart, and to the centre; and though moſt of their proviſions be bought in their own Country, yet Trade by Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing interrupted, and Taxes much raiſed and multiplyed, the people who bears the greateſt burthen of them muſt needs be diſenabled to pay, and conſequently, the whole Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57548:134"/>ſeeing the people ever makes the greateſt part of it, and that Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Work-men are they who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and get moneys for great and rich men, ſo that they fill the purſe: I account therefore that State to be rich, where all, or at leaſt the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Subjects are ſo; now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed money is ſtirring, but the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and great Officers have the Chief benefit of it, though indeed every one muſt need have a ſhare in it, ſo many men being employed upon ſeveral things, but Taxes take it away again; ſo that the Subject is poor, and the publick Treaſure empty; for the Trade by Land, and the plenty of their States makes them hold out: but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the preſent occaſions afford nothing to be laid up. Upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion as this, War affords gain to one great man or other, but deprives thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of their due. That General <hi>Foſcolo</hi> who hath been ſo much talked of, left, a report goes, above two Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Duckets in his Coffers, which he had gotten in few months time, but his Army was much the worſe for it:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57548:134"/>Therefore I conclude, that this long and chargeable, War which the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick hath againſt the <hi>Turk,</hi> hath much waſted her Treaſure; and were it not for the loanes of particular men, ſhe had been diſenabled to hold out any longer; therefore ſhe ſtands in need of aſſiſtance from other Princes and States, in monies, as well as in men: and thereby many have been impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſhed, and ſome few made rich; ſo others are thereby grown better Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and States-men, having gotten a great experience in martial and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick affairs.</p>
               <p>And for the corruptions of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men, as I mentioned before, all are ſo fully convinced that their particular ſafety lyes in that of the Republick, that they are unanimous in the defence of it; beſides that Laws there are ſo ſevere to Delinquents againſt the State, that hardly any man dares to be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his duty upon important occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; ſo that although ſome of their Noblemen grow rich upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the preſent <hi>Turkiſh</hi> War, and they are glad it doth laſt, yet they dare
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57548:135"/>not commit any baſe action, though it were upon no other ground, but for fear of a ſure and ſevere puniſhment: yet I am perſwaded that many of them act out of better principles then this, for although <hi>Venetians</hi> have defects and vices common to all other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet they have ſome vertues parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to themſelves, amongſt which gravity and ſettledneſs of mind (which <hi>Nepolitans</hi> and many of <hi>Lombardy</hi> are deprived of) are none of the leaſt.</p>

               </head>
               <p>BUt becauſe the War of <hi>Candia</hi> is at preſent the greateſt concern of the Republick, men will expect to hear ſome particulars of it; and herein I am willing in part to gratifie their curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, yet I do not intend to go back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſo many years, and ſpeak of this War from the beginning of it, which proved ſo fatal to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and imported no leſs then the loſs of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Kingdome, which the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Victories obtained ſince by Sea cannot make amends for: This would be too long a task, therefore I will look no further back then theſe two laſt years, or thereabouts, and as it were the renewing of the War.</p>
               <p>The Turk immediately after the great loſs he had ſuffered at the River <hi>Raab</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> having concluded a peace with the Emperour (who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deprived himſelf of the fruits of ſo notable a Victory, and of the advantage he might have received from the auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57548:136"/>Forces he had out of <hi>Germany</hi> and other Countries, and who thereby gave his Enemies Army time to breath after ſo great a blow, and to ſettle in his new Conqueſts) he turned his thoughts towards <hi>Candia,</hi> knowing full well the importance of that Iſland for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns againſt thoſe parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; therefore to alter the Scene, and make the <hi>Venetians</hi> look to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who, though they ſeemed at that time to be at a ſtand, had blocked up <hi>Canea</hi> by Sea, and hindered ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of men and proviſion from going into't, thereby to bring ſo troubleſom a Neighbour to ſome ſtraits, he reſolv'd to attempt the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> and to reduce the Republick only to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive: And becauſe the Gran Viſier had been more fortunate in taking of places, then in the Field, he would try whether <hi>Candia</hi> would run the Fate of <hi>Newhauſel:</hi> To this effect he is ſent over with an Army of about fourſcore thouſand men, with all neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for their deſign.</p>
               <p>At firſt he endeavoured to carry it by ſeveral deſperate aſſaults he made
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57548:136"/>againſt it, being put upon it, in part to draw ſome benefit from the courage and ſtrength of his Souldiers, who then were freſh, and alſo out of hopes that the <hi>Venetians</hi> might happen not to be prepared againſt that ſudden ſtorm; but they who were ſurprized the firſt time that this Iſland was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, had learned at their own coſt to be ready againſt a ſecond aſſault; and therefore with much courage and reſolution they repulſed and beat off the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Forces. Whereupon the Gran Viſier betook himſelf to new Counſels, and reſolved upon a formal Siege, ſeeing his other way had not proved ſucceſsful; and thereupon writ to his Maſter for new ſupplies, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him hopes of a good ſucceſs, and that in time he would be able to give him a good account of the place: ſo that there he ſits down before it, and ſo is engaged to conquer or to dye, his head being to anſwer for the ſucceſs of his undertaking.</p>
               <p>The Republick being more then awaked at this (yet glad to ſee the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57548:137"/>firſt brunt over) according to her uſual care and diligence, prepares at home to oppoſe that numerous ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and ſends continual ſupplies of men, moneys, ammunition and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the beſieged, with promiſes of more timely to be ſent to them, which to effect the more eaſily, they make themſelves ſtrong by Sea, and reſolved to keep the Maſtery of it. On the other ſide, they ſent to moſt Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> to repreſent the common danger, and the urgent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Republick: In conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which they deſired ſome aſſiſtance, as they had asked before, and obtained it, <hi>viz.</hi> 5000 men from the <hi>French</hi> commanded by one Prince of the Family of <hi>Modena,</hi> and from ſome other Princes, even particular men having contributed to it, as <hi>Mazarini</hi> 100000 Crowns, Cardinal <hi>Franceſco Barbarini</hi> ſet out a Galley at his own charges, and ſome others had done the like; which had been diſcontinued, becauſe the War in <hi>Hungary</hi> againſt the Emperour, had taken the edge
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57548:137"/>off from that of <hi>Candia;</hi> but the <hi>Turks</hi> as I ſaid, falling to it again, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick deſires new ſupplies almoſt every where, which ſhe obtained from ſeverall Parts.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſhe knew the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a brave and experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, to make him General in the beſieged City, ſhe ſent to ask of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> the General of his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Marquis <hi>Villa,</hi> who was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a conſiderable ſupply of men; he went to <hi>Venice,</hi> and thence with all convenient ſpeed he ſhipt away for <hi>Candia,</hi> where he puts every thing in a good order and poſture of defence, and upon all occaſions repulſes the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my with loſs, from the places he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. On the other ſide the <hi>Turk</hi> finds it a great difficulty to ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny recruits to the Viſier; for not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many of the Janizaries and other Souldiers, either run away from their Colours, or elſe fall into a mutiny, refuſing to be ſhipt for <hi>Candia,</hi> which they look upon as their grave, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting ſtill that the <hi>Divan</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57548:138"/>in the former deſign to deſtroy them; and thoſe others who were ſhipt either by force, or by the means of fair promiſes, were ſeveral times intercepted by the <hi>Venetians,</hi> who were cruſing up and down the coaſts of <hi>Morea,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Candia,</hi> and ſo towards thoſe Iſlands of the <hi>Arci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago,</hi> whence the Viſier might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably expect any relief. So that by theſe means the Turks Army was brought to great ſtraits; and at the ſame time God did fight againſt them from Heaven, ſending his arrows of the Plague and diſeaſes amongſt them, ſo that thereby the Army being much leſſened aad diſheartened, many went from their Colours, and did much complain, if not mutiny, and the Rains falling thereupon, forced the Viſier to withdraw further off from the City, giving thereby time of refreſhment to his Army, and to the beſieged alſo; who immediately after fell a repairing of thoſe Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications which had been endamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Turks in this <hi>Campag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na:</hi>
                  <pb n="245" facs="tcp:57548:138"/>The <hi>Turks</hi> loſt abundance of men, their Army being reduced, as was thought, to 20000 at the moſt: The <hi>Venetians</hi> alſo loſt ſeveral Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and ſome few men of note, and gallant Officers.</p>
               <p>In the VVinter the Sultan was ſolicitous to aſſiſt the Viſier againſt Spring; ſo were the <hi>Venetians</hi> of ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new ſupplies to the beſieged. Some thouſands paſſed from <hi>Morea</hi> to the Camp; <hi>Candia</hi> alſo received ſome; but withall, thoſe which the <hi>Venetians</hi> received from the Emperour, and from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the way of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> were ſtopt by reaſon of the war which broke forth in <hi>Flanders:</hi> And ſeveral other Princes and States began ſomwhat to give over the thoughts of <hi>Candia,</hi> to look another way; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> went on vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly, for though the enemies were come again before the City, yet ſtill keeping Maſters of the Sea, they put into the City all manner of neceſſary ſupplies, whereby the beſieged were enabled to hold out, and reſiſt the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57548:139"/>aſſaults of the <hi>Turks</hi> now 'gainſt one place, and then againſt another, it being known that no Nation falls on with more fury then the <hi>Turks,</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſwaded by the opinion they have of predeſtination, I mean as to their life, which is mixt with a great errour, to wit, of ſeparating the means from the end. But this matter I muſt ſpeak no more of, to ſay, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by reaſon of a deſign he ſeemed to have againſt <hi>Geneva</hi> and them, concerning himſelf in the War between <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> though the time was not come for him openly to declare it, he called home the Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> from the <hi>Venetian</hi> Service to give him again the General Command of his Forces. The Republick deſired he might have leave to ſtay longer; the Pope himſelf joyned his ſollicitations to theirs; but the Duke would not revoke his Order, only allowed him time to leave things in the beſt poſture he could poſſibly do, which he did, and to come home from <hi>Venice</hi> to give an account of the place; but before, he exploited many brave
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57548:139"/>things, not only repulſing couragiouſly the <hi>Turks</hi> when they came to ſtorm any Fort, but alſo by making luſty Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes upon them, and upon occaſion by ſpringing Mines under them, and blowing them up, whereby thouſands of them were deſtroyed at ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>Now are the <hi>Venetians</hi> put again to 't, to get a man of credit and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to be General in <hi>Candia.</hi> And ſince I brought it again to the purpoſe, I muſt not omit to ſay, that few years before, they had ſought after an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> man, a perſon of great worth, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and experience, to enter into their ſervice, who willingly embraced ſuch a motion, and had done it in a way as glorious and honourable as can be the Government of <hi>Candia,</hi> though of a different nature, had not ſome thing fallen out by the way: And the merit of this ſame perſon was ſo well known, and ſo eſteemed abroad, that he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame offers and invitations from the Emperour, as they were made known to him by a great Prince of the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57548:140"/>Empire: But this, as the other, took no effect. This paſſage I would not omit, it tending to the honour of the Engliſh Nation, that the Republick ſhould look ſo for and chooſe one of the Nation to carry on a deſign ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious as that which they had then in hand, and that the Emperour ſhould overlook <hi>Germany,</hi> a warlike Nation, to find in <hi>England</hi> a perſon fit for his purpoſe; and let this alſo be ſpoken to the honour of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>I return now to the <hi>Venetians</hi> where I left them, that is, looking for a man fit to ſuccced the Marquis <hi>Villa</hi> in his Command in <hi>Candia;</hi> they find him in <hi>France</hi> a perſon indeed well qualified for ſuch an imployment, but ſomwhat aged; he is of the proteſtant Religion, of a very noble Family in the Province of <hi>Dauphind,</hi> who ever produced men very zealous for the intereſt of their Religion, upon whoſe account ſome have loſt their lives; the name of the Family is <hi>Monbrun,</hi> the Eldeſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a Marqueſs, and they have been ſo
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57548:140"/>long agoe. Now this St. <hi>Andrè Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun</hi> hath been Lieutenant General of the French Armies in <hi>Italy,</hi> he harken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the propoſals made to him by the Republick, and begins a Treaty with her by the leave and conſent of his King, which being concluded he marches towards <hi>Venice,</hi> to go thence and take poſſeſſion of his Charge.</p>
               <p>In the mean while <hi>Alexander</hi> the Seventh being dead, and the preſent being choſen and ſettled, the <hi>Venetians</hi> receive much encouragement from him, not only aſſiſting them himſelf, but alſo ſolliciting others to do the like<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> In the mean time the beſieged in <hi>Candia</hi> have much adoe to defend themſelves from the reiterated Aſſaults of their Enemies, who having received ſome freſh ſupplies of men, though not very conſiderable, and being encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the promiſes of more, and put on by the obſtinate Reſolution of the Grand Viſier, who ſees his Head lying at the ſtake, and his life or death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the good or bad ſucceſs of the Siege, they fell a ſtorming of the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:57548:141"/>place twenty-five and thirty thouſand at a time, and neglect no other wayes that could promote the deſign: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having obſerved the great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they met withall, cauſed chiefly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the beſieged could at any time receive new ſupplies, the Harbour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free and open, they were contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a way to raiſe a Battery, which ſhould command the coming into the Port; and in this they were favoured by the directions they had from a Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, ſo that it took effect for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, inſomuch that no Ships could come in without a great danger; and then indeed people began to fear very much for the City; yet the <hi>Venetian</hi> Armata being come that way, ſome Sallyes being made, and Counter-Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries raiſed, the Harbour was again free and open: Yet the deſigns of the Enemy do ſtill lye that way, and their moſt frequent and furious aſſaults have ever been againſt the Forts which are towards thoſe Parts of the City, as are that of <hi>Mooenigo,</hi> and <hi>Panigra,</hi> but eſpecially St. <hi>Andre</hi> and <hi>Sabionera.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:57548:141"/>
               <p>Theſe continual Aſſaults given of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten once a Week, and ſomtimes two or three dayes one after another, and this for many hours without interruption, could not but extraordinarily tire thoſe within the City, and leſſen their number; and indeed, had it not been for the good Examples and Orders they have from ſeveral good Officers that are amongſt them, and the great care the Republick hath taken to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them from time to time, they could not in probability have held out ſo long. 'Tis true that their Gunners, and moſt belonging to the Artillery, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it admirably well; and from them in <hi>Candia</hi> and at Sea the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick receives great ſervice: But for all this, which indeed are reallities, they were fed with hopes, and flattered with promiſes of conſiderable ſuccours, which indeed were preparing for them, but alas, not with the ſucceſs which was expected from them, for u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually there hath been an unhappy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding between the Auxilaries and the Republicks Ships, or amongſt
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57548:142"/>themſelves; The Galleys of <hi>Maltha</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Geneva</hi> muſt not meet there, or elſe they will fall out about certain differences that are between them; and even the laſt Summer thoſe of <hi>Maltha</hi> took exceptions, and came away, becauſe they would not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieged to ſalute the <hi>Capitana</hi> or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Galley of <hi>Venice;</hi> and at the ſame time the Galleys of the Pope, and thoſe of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> which, after the Peace was concluded between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> the Pope had obtained, ſhould be ſent to aſſiſt the <hi>Venetian,</hi> went as it ſeems only to ſee <hi>Candia,</hi> but not to fight, for they came ſoon away and before they were expected home; ſo that <hi>Vicenzo Roſpiglioſi.</hi> hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to brag of againſt <hi>Prior Bichi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And upon this account the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were indeed hard put to it in <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> inſomuch that the <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> was forced to diſarm ſome of his Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys firſt, and then a Galleyaſs, and land the Souldiers and Rowers to fight in the defence of the City; which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57548:142"/>the Turk did not let ſlip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but he ſent his Army out of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> ſeveral ſupplies of Men and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, which landed all ſafely and without any interruption, becauſe at that time the <hi>Venetian</hi> Armata could not keep at Sea, and at the ſame time fight within the City: Then were their courage and valour put to a hard tryal, as indeed many did in an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary manner, ſome of which loſt their lives in the Field of honour, and others out-lived to ſee themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, for indeed the Republick hardly leaves any great action to go without a reward, which encourages others to ſtrive after the ſame. Some <hi>Venetian</hi> Noblemen carried themſelves very gallantly in the repulſes they gave the <hi>Turks,</hi> eſpecially from the Fort St. <hi>Andè:</hi> the Rowers and Slaves, many of them, behaved themſelves very valiantly, it being obſerved that one of them in an aſſault of the <hi>Turks</hi> killed fourty with his own hand; yet for all this it had gone hard with them, for they had been overpowered; but it
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57548:143"/>was Gods pleaſure to bring them very ſeaſonably freſh men, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſupplyes, ſent from <hi>Venice,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of <hi>Naples,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur de St. Andre Monbrun</hi> with the former, which raiſed their ſpirits very much, ſo that ſince from time to time having received new ſupplies of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> they made Sallyes, and did execution upon the Enemy, venturing very far, the General himſelf in one of them receiving a Muſquet ſhot in one of his Shoulders, though not dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
               <p>A thing which indeed kept up very much the hearts of the beſieged, was the hopes of ſuccours preparing for them in <hi>France,</hi> which to them was given out to be more forward then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it was: I muſt ſay ſomthing as to the nature of it: This was not ſent by the French Kings Order, but only by his permiſſion, upon this account; A French man of great courage and experience, named Count <hi>de la Fueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade,</hi> brought up in the French Armies,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57548:143"/>and who was in this late War in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> having taken it ill, as the report goes, that in the late promotion, he was not made a Marſhal of <hi>France,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of which the King his Maſter had a while before made him <hi>Duke of Roannes</hi> and Peer of <hi>France;</hi> or rather, as I am apt to beleeve, out of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial deſire, ſeeing peace concluded at home, reſolved upon this ſervice, with the Kings leave, and levied three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand brave fighting men, of which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove eight hundred are old Officers; and having Shipt them at <hi>Marſeilles</hi> he ſailed towards <hi>Maltha</hi> to take in 40 Knights of his Nation, men willing to venture their lives in the defence of <hi>Candia,</hi> to whoſe ſuccour alſo the <hi>Grand Maltez</hi> hath ſent three hundred men; from whence they ſailed all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether towards <hi>Candia,</hi> where they are now arrived according to their deſire, and to the great ſatisfaction of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged, and very likely they will fall upon action whilſt they are freſh, and before the Climate, and perhaps a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute manner of life, do work diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers amongſt them.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:57548:144"/>
               <p>But to return to the Siege, the Vifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hearing of great ſuccours expected in <hi>Candia,</hi> would haſten to do ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before their arrival; but for two dayes together being repulſed with the loſs, as 'tis thought, of about ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, he was diſheartned as well as his Army; which having wrought a contrary effect upon the beſieged, they made ſome Sallyes, which joyned to the Rains, which towards the end of <hi>Autumn</hi> fell there abundantly, have made the Grand Viſier to retire, with a deſign, as 'tis very probable, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on again; in the mean while the <hi>Venetians</hi> are very much refreſhed by the arrival of their expected ſuccours of <hi>French, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> the number of which comes to about ten thouſand men, who likely will ſend out ſome parties to look abroad, if there be occaſion for't. On the other ſide, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received Pioneers, and other work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with ſome materials, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout repairing their Fortifications, which muſt needs have received great dammages, by the ſpringing up of ſo
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57548:144"/>many Mines about them, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the <hi>Turks</hi> Artillery, of which they ever have great quantity, and of the greater ſort, it being their cuſtom not to draw them to Sieges as other Nations uſe, but they caſt them in their Camp, and when they are to march off, they break them to pieces, which they carry away: By theſe means they are freed of the trouble and the charges which do attend trains of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; and ſo they caſt them as big as they will, and to carry bullets of what weight they pleaſe, and then the continual ſhooting of this Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery muſt needs ſhake any Works and and Fortifications how ſtrong ſoever they be: Yet againſt this the beſieged have ſecured themſelves the beſt they could, for <hi>Candia,</hi> which formerly was a ſweet and a pleaſant place, is now wholly made a City of War, and as I am informed by ſome lately come from thence, their Souldiers for the moſt part are lodged under Vaults, Caves, and other places under ground, where they are ſecure enough from the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57548:145"/>till they be called to the defence of the breach when any is made.</p>
               <p>This is the preſent poſture of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> which hath now time to breath till the Enemy falls on again; which when it comes, God knows what will be the ſucceſs of it, for oftentimes valour being over-powered, muſt at laſt yield to number; wherefore the Republick is at preſent ſolliciting for help almoſt every where by the means of the Ambaſſadours ſhe hath ſent to moſt Courts; and as according to all probability <hi>Candia</hi> is ſecured enough for this Winter, ſo ſufficient prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are to be made to reſiſt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts which on the next Spring ſhall be made againſt it, there being a timely warning given of it. I ſay further, that if the Republick was ſomewhat Aſſiſted, ſhe could be able, not only to ſecure the City of <hi>Candia,</hi> but if ſhe could form any indifferent body of Army about it, to get ground of the <hi>Turk</hi> from keeping the Maſtery of the Sea, they could receive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:57548:145"/>ſupplies of all manner of things when the Enemy ſhould want it; for ſtopping thoſe which he receives from <hi>Morea,</hi> and few other places, his Army could not ſubſiſt, becauſe, though the Iſland of <hi>Candia</hi> be of a good and fruitfull ſoyle, yet at preſent it is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and deſolate, the ground being neither tilled nor manured, it being the <hi>Turks</hi> cuſtome to deſtroy the places of their Conqueſts, to make them void of Inhabitants, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful. Now in this caſe the Viſier and his Army ſhould be as birds in a Cage, and could wiſh themſelves far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off, or that they had never come there; ſo that it may be ſaid of him, he is fallen into the ſnare he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for others: and truly ſhould he and his Army periſh in this, it would prove a ſore and a fatall blow to the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire. And I pray to God, who hath the hearts of all men in his hand, even thoſe of Kings, which he turns like Rivers of waters, to make Chriſtian Princes ſo ſenſible of it, as to work upon them a deſire, and a taking
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:57548:146"/>ſuch an effectual courſe as might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the great Intereſt of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> againſt the Common Enemy; for if ever it be done, I am fully perſwaded it muſt be the effect of a ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and providence of God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling the hearts and intereſts of men, without their deſigns, and even againſt it, for he is able to move, bow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the wills of men as it ſeems good unto him.</p>
